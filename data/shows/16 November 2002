segment:Genius Karl Pilkington

Ricky: Foo Fighters. All My Life on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me Steve Merchant and uh, Karl Pilkington.
Steve: Indeed.
Ricky: Genius Karl Pilkington as Heat magazine said.
Steve: Really, is that what he's referred to now?
Ricky: Yeah, yeah.
Steve: Oh.
Ricky: Genius. Saying about people tune in just to hear his games such as...Educating Ricky. Have you got some Educating Ricky for me?
Karl: Got some Educating Ri-...
Ricky: I need some education Karl. I desperately need some education.
Karl: Got some later.
Ricky: I wanna learn about Chinese kids that are born hairier than average.
Steve Laughs
Ricky: I wanna her-hear about deaf girls that can hear after their mum hits their head against a wall. These are the things I need to know.
Steve: I mean I don't wish to be disrespectful. He doesn't look like a genius.
Ricky: He doesn't look like a genius.
Steve: But I don't know what a genius looks like, Rick.
Ricky: Exactly...
Steve: So, you know...
Ricky: ...Steve.
Karl: Lo-lo-look at Einstein.
Ricky and Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: His mum thought he was mental as a child.
Ricky snickers
Steve: Where'd you get that information from?
Karl: That was in the Einstein book.
Ricky Laughs
Ricky: If it was in the Einstein book then it's presumably true.
Steve: Which Einstein book is that? Is it Theory of relativity?
Ricky: The big book of Einstein stuff.
Steve: Oh yeah, yeah.
Ricky: Yeah, the big book of Einstein stuff. It's for a coach trip and you have to fill in E equals MC, one: squared, two: fish or three: hello and then it's multiple choice and then you fill it, it's great.
Steve: Did his mum think A: he was a genius? B: mental.
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Ricky: Some, most people go for A, but it is in fact B. She thought he was mental at the age of 28. Oh, Karl. You never let me down. You NEVER let me down. So, have you got Educating Ricky for me?
Karl: Got Educating Ricky coming up.
Ricky: You've got Rockbusters.
Karl: We've got Rockbusters.
Steve: Some great prizes as well.
Ricky: As seen and talked about in Heat.
Steve Laughs
Steve: In Heat magazine.
Karl: It's got really tough this week now. We're not messing about anymore.
Steve: Uh-huh.
Ricky: Right.
Karl: Got some good prizes.
Steve: Absolutely and we'll talk about those later. Uh, cause I mean, was it last week you had the classic, was it, um, I can't remem-, I'm paraphrasing here Karl, apologies, something like I'm here in Texas. I've fallen in a puddle and my knee has got wet.
Ricky: Yeah, wet-knee Houston.
Steve: Wet-knee Houston. Whitney Houston.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And also, it was last week when there was a little bit of confunsion over, uh, the one for Holly Valence, right.
Steve: Of course.
Karl: Um...
Steve: I don't think it was confusion. I think it was your error.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: No no no, it wasn't. It was...
Ricky: It was holy valence and you meant pelmet.
Karl: Ah, then...
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: ...Becky who called up that time and said "Ah if, you-you get a mistaken with pelmet, right, she sent me an in a week.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Sayin', "I done a bit of research."
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: "It was my fault. I've mad an error."
Ricky: Yeah
Karl: "It is a valence."
Ricky: Okay.
Karl: And I know about valences as I told you last week, at very end, me Auntie loves em.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Right. She um...she makes em'. She started off just like putting em' on top of the, uh, sorta' window round' the curtain. And then she-she thought "Oh, I can do more with this."
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: And she had a little coffe table that had magazines underneath...
Steve: Yeah
Karl: ...and she said "Oh, I'm sick o' seein' those magazines when I'm sat down."
Steve: She sounds...
Ricky Laughs
Steve: ...she sounds like a Pilkington.
Karl: So...
Ricky Continues To Laugh
Ricky: "I'm sick of seein' them magazines when I sit down."
Karl: So she put a valence round' the table...
Ricky: Yeah, yeah
Steve: So it's got valences round' everything now?
Karl: Then...
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: ...next step. She tapes everything. She never actually watches telly, she tapes it all...
Ricky: Yeah
Karl: ...cause she gets sick of listening to the adverts and that.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: So she tapes everything. So she's got loads of video tapes and that and the video used to get on her nerves, when she was watcing a film she'd see the clock changing.
Steve: Oh.
Karl: ...and it'd distract her from the film so she put a valence round' that.
Steve: Of course.
Ricky Laughs
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: That's genius. Yeah
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: So...
Ricky: That is really...
Steve: Or...or is it mental?
Ricky: I don't know.
Steve: Only Mrs. Einstein can tell us.
Ricky: I don't know. She's even made her little, um, Jack Russell look like a hover craft.
Karl: If you stand still, that's it.
Steve: So, everything's got a valence?
Karl: It's, if you go round' and you stand still for too long the chances are that she'll put a valence round' your head.
Steve Laughs
Ricky: This the, uh, this Auntie who?
Karl: Auntie Nora.
Ricky: And this is the one who farted for five minutes.
Steve Laughs
Ricky: Lest our listeners forget.
Steve: Lest we forget.
Ricky: Farted for fives minutes, called his mum saying "I'm farting." two minutes into the fart.
Karl: She said "I'm about two-and-a-half minutes in."
Ricky Laughs
Steve: She said "I'm about two-and-a-half minutes into the fart."
Karl: Well, me me mum said "How longs it been going on for?" She said "Well, it was about two-and-a-half minutes before I called you."
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: And then it went on for a further two, two-and-a-half minutes or something.
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: And uh, then it stopped. And, uh...
Ricky: She couldn't time her cause there was a valence over the clock. Cause it used to annoy her when she on the phone. It would put her off. She was guessing it was five minutes.
Steve: This was one consistent fart.
Karl: Yeah. I mean it wasn't making a noise. It was just...
Steve: Oh, it wasn't making a noise?
Karl: Just gas.
Ricky Snickers
Steve: Right, endless gas.
Karl: So, uh there you go.
Ricky: That's fantastic. Well, we started off with a new one. A little bit of Foo Fighters. We like new and old on this show, don't we.
Steve: Indeed. We like to mix it up.
Ricky: I'd like to play, this is Smiths from there debut album, um, I Don't Owe You Anything.
Song: Smiths - I Don't Owe You Anything

segment:Can't Move For Soil

Ricky: "I Don't Owe You Anything", the lads from Karl's hometown there.
Steve: Indeed.
Ricky: The Smiths. Brilliant, that one. Well, I went to Manchester, didn't I, the other day? Went to Manchester for a little corporate.
Steve: What did you make of it?
Ricky: It was all right. The - he went, "Wait 'til you get out", he said, because it's better than Houston.
Steve: Right.
Ricky: It was, the - you know, it was nicer. I went outside and there was a ridiculous queue and sort of one cab.
Steve: Right, yeah.
Ricky: So ---
Steve: Horse-drawn?
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: And so, I walked. And it was okay, it was only down the road. A bit dark. It was wet and raining, of course.
Steve: Obviously, it's the North.
Ricky: I know, yeah. Hotel was very nice, but no mini-bar. Never seen that before. I've travelled all over the world, Steve, I've never had a hotel without a mini-bar.
Steve Snickers
Steve: No, I've never heard that.
Ricky: So, I don't know what's going on there and - I don't know what's going on there. And then I had this corporate gig in Old Trafford. The pitch was up, I don't know what they were doing. But, you know, very impressive. Big, impressive. I think they were Richard's football club, aren't they, Karl?
Karl: Yep.
Steve: You did a gig at where?
Ricky: Old Trafford. It was in a function room, there, so ---
Steve: Oh, well, I thought it was the stadium.
Ricky: No, no.
Steve: In the player hall.
Ricky: I'm not that big yet.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: No. But, I mean, you know, I can't really comment on Manchester. I do know that Liverpool was voted, "Most important music city" by a poll.
Steve: True enough.
Ricky: So - Karl, you're making noises while I'm talking.
Karl: Yeah. But you do this all the time, trying to wind me up. And I'm not saying Manchester's the best place in the world, but what I'm saying is there's bits of it that I really miss.
Ricky: Yep.
Karl: Like, last Sunday, right? When I met up with Ricky. We had spaghetti bolognese, which was all right.
Ricky Laughs
Karl: And then I said to him, I said, "I need some soil."
Steve: Damn, I wish you'd invited me. It sounds ---
Ricky Laughs
Steve: --- amazing.
Karl: Right? Listen. I said, "I need some soil, what do you think?"
Steve: You need some what? Soil?
Ricky: Soil, yeah.
Karl: Soil. I need to re-pot a plant, right?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: So ---
Steve: You need to re-pot a plant?
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: I - oh, fair enough.
Karl: So, I'm like, "Where" - you can't see these shops in London.
Steve: Okay, yeah. You can't buy soil?
Karl: Do you know what I mean? There's nothing around.
Ricky: I took him straight to one in my street.
Karl: Yeah, but near your street and thats probably the only one in London.
Ricky: Well, you say that, Karl.
Karl: No, it does annoy me. 'Round my way it's like, you know---
Steve: You can't move for soil, sure.
Ricky Laughs
Ricky: Karl, there's earth, you can just pick up handfuls walking down the street.
Steve: Yeah. Incredible.
Ricky: You just ---
Steve: Just lean over into someone's front garden.
Ricky: Yeah, yeah.
Steve: You can take the plants as well.
Karl: No, what I'm saying is ---
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: --- Manchester, there's loads of decent hardware shops.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Here, you know, if you want a panini and a latte or whatever, you can't move for 'em. But for soil, I had to go virtually - how many miles away from me to carry out soil home and stuff?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: It's not got - I mean, London's all right. But if cities were sort of marked ---
Ricky: It's neglecting the peat market, really, isn't it?
Steve Snickers
Steve: Yeah. Well, there's barely - I mean, there's barely any mulch available, Rick.
Ricky: Well, I ---
Steve: In Central London.
Ricky: I'm sick and tired of not getting a good, decent compost on a Sunday.
Steve: Indeed.
Ricky: So ---
Steve: It sickens me.
Ricky: --- you know, I'm thinking of moving to the North.
Steve Snickers
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: Where there is loads of soil and gravel.
Steve Snickers
Steve: Indeed.
Ricky: And animal shite.
Steve Snickers
Karl: Well, whatever.
Ricky: Yeah. So ---
Karl: Whatever.
Steve: So, you were going to say if you were marking cities out of 10, what would you give London?
Karl: Well, if you were marking them on, like, you know, on what they have ---
Steve: Right.
Ricky: As opposed to what?
Karl: Well, as opposed to ---
Ricky: How you spell it?
Steve: The name.
Karl: Say - like, I think the greatest city in the world is Rome, right?
Ricky: Okay.
Karl: It's pretty amazing.
Steve: M'mm.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Have you been?
Ricky: What - yeah. Why do you think that, though?
Karl: Just because, like, you turn a corner and there's something there that's really old. Right?
Ricky Snickers
Steve: Right.
Karl: Like---
Steve and Ricky snicker.
Karl: --- you're going down a normal street---
Ricky: Go and stay in a Darby and Joan club.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: No, no, no. But it's like you're going down the road and then you turn a corner and, like, the Colosseum's in the middle of a - like, a busy road.
Ricky: M'mm.
Karl: It's like, what's that doing there?
Steve: Yeah, yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And just when you think there's no more, you turn another corner and ---
Ricky: It's almost as if that was there first.
Ricky Laughs
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Well ---
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: But, do you know what I mean? London ---
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: --- what have we got? You know, Trafalgar Square's world - sort of world known. And you go there, and what's there?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Do you know what I mean? So, there's a lot of space there. Get one big B&Q ---
Steve: In Trafalgar Square?
Karl: --- to cater for the whole of the people who live, sort of, Central London-ish.
Steve: Yeah, yeah.
Karl: And then I'd be happy. But what I'm saying is ---
Ricky: What, with Nelson just popping up through the middle?
Steve snickers
Ricky: 'Cause you could still see it, couldn't you?
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: It's a great idea.
Ricky: B&Q - that - so, B&Q could be, like, the whole sort of flat thing and they make it sort of grey so it looked like rock and then Nelson popping up ---
Steve: Make it classy is what you're saying.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Stone clad it.
Steve: Yeah.
Steve Snickers
Ricky: So it looks like you've made an effort.
Steve: Exactly.
Steve Snickers
Ricky: And then you can pop in and then you can go out and go, "Oh look, Nelson's Column. Oh, look, it's Nelson - oh, look at that. The victory. Oh, the feat, that's fantastic. One of the greatest living" ---
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: "I need some nails."
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: Yeah. Perfect. Killing two birds with one stone, you're saying.
Karl: But why don't - why isn't there more than - more than them shops? Because when I went in to yours, every time I've been in there, I've been in there twice now. The first time was to get a shower head. Right?
Ricky Snickers
Steve: Right.
Karl: And I went in there, couldn't resist buying something else and I ended up getting some super glue as well.
Ricky Laughs
Steve: Why?
Karl: Right?
Steve: Hey, big spender.
Karl: And then ---
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: --- last Sunday we went in there, got two bags of soil. Not one, I bought two.
Ricky: Yeah, yeah.
Karl: And I bought some scissors to cut plants with.
Ricky: Secateurs.
Karl: Scissors.
Steve: Well, you don't - you never know when you want - you know, you might need more soil, I suppose.
Ricky: M'mm.
Karl: Well, I've got ---
Steve: You're (?) up now. Where do you keep it, under your bed?
Ricky: Sorry, this isn't going out, is it, this conversation? It's not going out on air?
Steve: I got a feeling it might be.
Ricky: You're joking. We better play a record.
Steve: Okay.
Ricky: Play a classic.
Song: The Hives – Hate to Say I Told You So

segment:The Hat-He-Chewed

Ricky: Hives, "Hate to Say I Told You So" on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, obviously. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl "Genius" Pilkington.
Steve snickers
Steve: Absolutely. I was watching a bit of TV ---
Ricky: Karl "The Brain" Pilkington.
Steve: Yeah. The Brain. Brains. Yeah. I was watching a bit of TV last night, Rick.
Ricky: Go on.
Steve: And I had a little thought ---
Ricky: Children in Need?
Steve: No, well, I didn't watch Children in Need.
Ricky: Oh, it was a treat.
Steve: I was watching something - I think it was last night, it was a bit earlier, I had a little thought for lads that might be out tonight, you know, on the raz.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Maybe they get a little bit of success with the ladies.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: This was something that struck me as I was watching it. A lot of gentlemen, you know, when they're engaged in, you know, an act of, you know, relations with a lady ---
Ricky: M'mm.
Steve: --- they like to sort of, you know, think of an image or something that will prevent them from, you know, *whistles*. And you get - you catch my drift. We're men in the world.
Ricky: Grandmother's funeral is the cliche isn't it?
Steve snickers
Steve: Exactly. And I tell you what I think it should be? Rik Waller jogging.
Ricky snickers.
Steve: I was watching Fit Club
Ricky: I know.
Steve: I have never seen ---
Ricky: I'm ---
Steve: --- anything like it, Rick.
Ricky: I like it when Harvey lost it with him.
Steve: Oh, man alive. I mean, I know I slag him off, but I do - I don't really like him either. I just think he comes across appallingly. And I think, you know ---
Ricky: When he just walked away when that - in that - mid-conversation talking to that bloke. They're doing it for his good, really.
Steve: I know. But he's - how - he's, like, 31 stone?
Ricky: I think he lost a bit. I think he's 29 now. Don't exaggerate, Steve.
Steve snickers
Ricky: You make him sound like a fat ---
Steve: But, you know - I mean, yeah.
Ricky: Oh, that was close, wasn't it?
Steve: When having sex, you know, apparently thinking of Rik Waller helps.
Ricky: Oh. Oh, don't - look what's happened.
Steve: Exactly.
Ricky: That's the reverse effect.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Oh, no, me and Karl ---
Steve: No, no, if you're with a lady, if you're with a lady ---
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: --- apparently that works.
Ricky: I know he's out now, isn't he? He's out.
Steve: He's - did he walk out?
Ricky: I think so. I think that's it, from what I can ---
Karl: No, no. I think next week, they kick him out 'cause I read something about he - they get rid of him next week 'cause of his attitude. And the first time I read it, I thought he'd actually ate someone's hat.
Ricky laughs
Karl: But was ---
Steve: You lost me there.
Ricky: Got rid of him 'cause of the "hat-he-chewed". Oh ---
Steve: Everything you think of now is puns.
Ricky laughs
Steve: You can't get puns out of your head, can you?
Ricky: Oh, Karl, you're great. Look at his little face.
Steve: He's so pleased.
Ricky: That is good.
Steve: How long have you been working on that? How long have you been working on ---
Ricky: You've gotta love - you've gotta give him that. That is a real joke.
Steve: No, that is - no, it is.
Ricky: Look at his face. He knew it was funny, it was meant to be funny, he said it to be funny. And it was. Well done.
Steve: I ---
Ricky: Well done.
Steve: I'm just interested, I just wanna dissect it 'cause it was brilliant and I'm wondering how long have you been working on it?
Karl: About two weeks.
Steve: Uh-huh.
Ricky laughs
Steve: Yeah, no, it's good stuff. It was worth the wait.
Karl: Can I go home now?
Steve laughs
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Oh, well done.
Steve: The hat he chewed. Attitude.
Ricky: I don't think - there's only one band that can top that, another band from Manchester, Oasis.
Steve: Oh.

segment:As Featured In

Ricky: The Vines, "Miss Jackson" on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Karl Pilkington. Right. Getting towards that time where Karl really kicks into action. We got the quiz. We got Rockbusters, the quiz that's a bit like Blockbusters, but mainly around music. Yeah, and a pun ---
Steve: It's a ---
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: --- based in wordplay by Karl. You know how good he is at that.
Steve: Can I tell you what the prizes are this week? 'Cause they're worth playing for.
Ricky: Please do.
Steve: Okay. We got on DVD the Manic Street Preacher's Greatest Hits on DVD. The videos, I'm assuming. The film, "Human Traffic", it's a remixed DVD version of that. I think we were giving this away last week, you've obviously got a bulk stock of these, Groove Armada's "Lovebox", an album from them. "The Best Air Guitar Album In The World Ever", that's got the likes of Queen, Adams, Palmer, Leopard, Idle ---
Ricky: Aerosmith?
Steve: I don't see Aerosmith.
Ricky: I think The Smiths should be on there.
Steve: We got Purple, Wolf, Cooper, Top.
Ricky laughs
Steve: Quo and 'back, Nickelback.
Ricky laughs
Steve: Now, there was another - there was another one around here, actually. I think we've lost one of the prizes, Karl. Oh, here we are.
Karl: Here it is
Steve: Yeah, this is - you may have seen this advertised on TV, "The Best Bands Ever" album. And just imagine who this is aimed at. It's got Oasis on there, Nickelback, Coldplay, da, da, da, The Dandy Warhols, "Bohemian Like You" (as featured in the Vodafone TV ads).
Ricky laughs
Steve: They've also got Smash Mouth, "Walkin' On The Sun" as featured in the Ford Fiesta TV ads.
Ricky: It's for people who didn't know they liked indie.
Steve: Exactly. Exactly.
Ricky: They go, 'I don't like indie." "But you do, did you like this advert?"
Steve laughs
Ricky: "Yeah."
Steve: "I love it."
Ricky: "Do you like this advert?", "Yeah." "Well, you like indie then." "I do! I love indie!"
Steve: "I can't believe it!"
Ricky: "That's great."
Steve: Yeah. The Mock Turtles, "Can You Dig It?", as featured in the Vodafone TV ads.
Ricky: "I really like indie."
Steve: "Do you love the T-Mobile TV ad?"
Ricky: "Yeah."
Steve: "You'll love this, it's got Royksopp on there, which is featured in that."
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Oh.
Steve: So, that's an album for people who don't like music.
Ricky: That's great. That's coming up, Rockbusters.
Steve: And I'll tell you what - but I also have a movie, 'cause you know last week I gave away "Executive Decision".
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: That was on TV last night.
Ricky: Yes.
Steve: For those who didn't receive my copy.
Ricky: But were they - probably watched it before it was on TV.
Steve laughs
Steve: And indeed - yeah.
Ricky: Few days before.
Steve: I was clearing out, Rick.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Last night, I found another one which might be - just to entice people.
Ricky: Go on. What is it?
Steve: Coming right out, here.
Ricky: It's coming out the bag.
Steve: "The Pelican Brief."
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Oh.
Steve: Another arbitrary film choice on VHS.
Ricky laughs
Steve: Pelican Brief. Roberts, Washington. You know it's there ---
Ricky: Get it now on VHS.
Steve: --- in Choices within 6.99.
Ricky: Before there are no more VHS' around.
Steve: It's 6.99, I'm giving that away as well, Pelican Brief
Ricky: That's great, and that's his personal collection. That ---
Steve: That's from my personal collection.
Ricky: Did you see that picture Karl brought in?
Steve: I don't think it's even rewound from when I watched it.
Ricky: Really?
Steve: No, it's not. You can rewind that yourself.
Ricky: Brilliant. That's a little touch of Steve Merchant there.
Steve: Yeah, exactly.
Ricky: Did you see that picture that he brought in?
Steve: I'd have, actually. Can I see it again, Karl? Yeah, it's just a picture of - this is - you carry it with you, do you, when you're walking outside?
Karl: No, no.
Ricky: No, no. He found it, right?
Karl: Last week, I was sorting - 'cause I'm moving, I'm sorting all me files out and that.
Ricky snickers
Karl: And because this is the only school picture I've got ---
Ricky: He had one school picture taken, when he was - what is that, 10 in 1981?
Karl: Oh, I was about 8 in - 8, around there.
Ricky: 8 and that? Okay. Tell the story. Why is that the only school picture they've taken?
Karl: Just because - no, I had them all - I was always had them taken, right? But me dad thought they were overpriced for what you get.
Steve: Uh-huh.
Ricky snickers
Karl: 'Cause really, it's a - they're - they're sort of - the whole idea of a good picture is, like, not only the person that's in it, but, like, the surroundings.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: So, like, if you're on holiday, you'll look at me and you'll go, "Oh, yeah, you're looking well there. What's that hill in the background?" Or something like that.
Steve: M'mm, m'mm.
Ricky snickers
Karl: Whereas with that ---
Ricky: "That's Rik Waller catching up."
Steve laughs
Ricky laughs
Karl: ---But on that - but all you get on these schools pictures is, like, a blue background, innit?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: So, he was like, "I'm not paying for that."
Steve: Sure.
Karl: And it was a big one, you get a bigger one than that. But that's just, like, a little passport size, innit?
Steve: Yeah, yeah.
Karl: That was £1.60
Ricky laughs
Steve: Okay.
Karl: And he wasn't really happy paying that, 'cause he said you could get, like, some done from Truprint for a lot cheaper.
Steve: So, he could take it himself?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: So ---
Ricky: And so did he tell you at the time that was the last time he was paying for a school picture?
Karl: He said, "I'll get you one because it's good to have a picture of you at school."
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: 'Cause I hardly ever went and all that.
Steve: M'mm.
Karl: So it was like ---
Ricky laughs
Ricky: "What's that in the background?" "That's my school, Dad." "Oh, I didn't" ---
Steve: "I don't recognise this."
Ricky laughs
Steve: "You got any interesting stories about it?" "Not really."
Ricky laughs
Karl: So, I was a good looking kid though, wasn't I?
Steve: You - what were you doing with your mouth though, Karl? It looks like you're sort of - it looks like - a bit like you're a ventriloquist dummy.
Karl: What do you mean?
Steve: Well, it looks like you - you're sort of scrunching your mouth up or pursing your lips or something. Do you not ---
Ricky: Oh.
Steve: I mean, now you've got, dare I say it, very kissable lips.
Ricky laughs
Steve: But in here, look how thin they are. Look at those, you know, thin lips. It's like you ---
Karl: I'm smiling.
Steve: That's a smile?
Ricky: Oh, that's what - I didn't recognise that either.
Steve: No, I didn't recognise that as a smile.
Karl: It's a smile.
Ricky: Oh, is that what you look like when you smile?
Karl: Yep.
Ricky: Oh.
Steve: And what's happening with the hair? 'Cause obviously ---
Ricky: Had your dad seen you smile before then?
Karl: Well, I think that's why he wanted to buy one as well. That's like so he can remember what it was like.
Ricky: Right.
Karl: 'Cause I don't smile.
Ricky: When did you stop smiling? When did you - when was the last time you had fun or you were sort of, like, happy-go-lucky? When can you remember when you had no weight of the world on your shoulders?
Karl: I often think that, 'cause I don't sleep like I did, like, when I was a kid. I had really good sleeps and now, I don't.
Ricky: Right.
Karl: So, I think once you lose ---
Steve: But you've got a lot of things on your mind? You know, "Where can I buy soil?"
Ricky: Yeah, "How can I confuse a computer by tapping in 'Why?' in the search engine?"
Karl: Probably when I was 14, I was stress-free.
Steve: Uh-huh.
Ricky: Were you?
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: When was the paper round?
Karl: Probably when I was 15.
Ricky: Right. So, that's when it started, was it?
Karl: I reckon, that's when I started getting stressed.
Steve: M'mm.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: I'm just looking at the haircut you've got in the - 'cause obviously I've not seen you before with hair and it's an interesting mop. Did you - do you have that done at the barber's?
Karl: No, me mum - mum used to do it.
Steve: She cut that?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: Right, did she ---
Karl: She used to, yeah. What she used to do ---
Ricky snickers
Karl: --- you can't see it in that picture, but there was one where she did a bit of a mess of it. I mean, it looks quite ---
Steve: Right, I can tell from this picture.
Ricky laughs
Karl: No, no, no, no, but that's one of the better ones.
Steve: Oh, really?
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Right. Were you bullied much?
Ricky laughs
Steve laughs
Karl: On one of them, she used to, like, use a bit of newspaper ---
Steve: Brilliant.
Karl: --- in front of me eyes so she didn't, like, stick the scissors in me eyes.
Steve laughs
Ricky: Well, newspaper stops scissors every time.
Steve: Yeah, 'cause they - I think they use that for bulletproof vests.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Yeah, the tough fabric of a reconstituted newspaper will stop the scissor any time.
Steve: No, definitely. I remember it - 'cause I know a lot of UN guides ---
Ricky snickers
Steve: --- when they're on patrol, they use some old copies of The Sun.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: They put it in their pockets.
Steve: Yeah, The Daily Star.
Ricky: Sorry, yeah, okay, yeah.
Karl: So, she used to always be on a Sunday night when, like, Songs of Praise is on or something, right?
Steve: Right.
Karl: Nothing's on the telly.
Steve: Sure.
Karl: Just before Last of the Summer Wine or something. And she used to get the ---
Ricky: What a depressing time that was.
Karl: It was.
Ricky: Having your hair cut and listening to Songs of Praise waiting for Last of the Summer Wine. I always used to get depressed on Sunday nights.
Steve: Well, I tell you what ---
Ricky: And it wasn't 'cause school was the next morning, it was because the telly was so shite.
Steve: I think it was because school was the next morning 'cause Antiques Roadshow still does that for me. I see the Antiques Roadshow, I love it, but I'm just thinking, "Oh, I gotta go to school." Or work tomorrow.
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: The Roadshow, I wish they put it on the weekend.
Ricky: But I know, I've never really had that - when I worked, I suppose - I work now, don't I?
Ricky snickers
Ricky snickers
Ricky: Oh, no. Oh, what a giveaway.
Steve: Not really.
Ricky: What a giveaway.
Ricky laughs
Steve: So, you were telling us a story about ---
Karl: But yeah. So, anyway, she used to get the newspaper.
Steve: Right.
Karl: And she'd stick it in front of me eyes and ---
Ricky snickers
Ricky: "What does that say?" Go on.
Karl snickers
Karl: So, she'd ---
Steve: You inherited a lot from your mum, didn't you?
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: So, she'd cut me fringe, right?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: But then she'd go, "Oh, it's not straight. It's not very good." So, she'd go again and she'd keep going and the problem is ---
Steve: Is that why you're bald now?
Ricky: I was going to say.
Steve laughs
Ricky: Is this - you have got hair, but she has to get it right.
Karl: No, no. Yeah.
Ricky: It takes her to the back of your neck to get it even.
Karl: So, she sort of removed the newspaper and she was like, "Oh, God." And I said, "What?" and she goes, "Oh, I'm sorry." And like ---
Ricky snickers
Ricky: What, did this happen every Sunday?
Karl: Not ---
Steve: Can I ask you, Karl, when she was cutting your hair in this picture, what - do you think she was, maybe, sidetracked by an interesting article in the paper?
Ricky laughs
Steve: And really wasn't paying attention to what she's doing?
Ricky: Yeah, yeah. Or did her favourite hymn come on?
Steve laughs
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: And she started singing ---
Steve: Or compo was rolling down the hill ---
Ricky laughs
Ricky: In a bar.
Steve laughs
Ricky laughs
Karl: So, yeah, I ended up with, like, you know, a fringe sort of on the back of me head 'cause she just kept going further and further.
Steve: Sure.
Karl: But - so ---
Ricky: When did you start going to that barber that was on the railway station?
Karl: Must've - that's when I started work. So, you know, sort of 16, 17.
Ricky: And is he the one that said you have the hair of a Chinaman?
Karl: He's the one that - yeah.
Ricky: He sounds like a wise man.
Karl: And ---
Steve: Can I just stop - I think maybe we should play a tune. But maybe you can bring in some photos next week, Rick, and we can talk about them on the radio.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Yeah. And I'm just gonna do a card trick. Right, take a card.
Steve laughs
Ricky: Any card, yeah? Right, look at it.
Steve: Uh-huh.
Ricky: Is that your card?
Steve: That's mine.
