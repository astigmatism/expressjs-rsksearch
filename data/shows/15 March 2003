Ricky: On XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me Steve Merchant and back Karl Pilkington.
Steve: Ehhh!
Ricky: He's rarin' to go. That's nice when you have a bit of time off, innit?
Steve: Yeah, how long have you had off now then, Karl?
Ricky: About three weeks.
Steve: About three weeks, is it?
Ricky: About three weeks, yeah. Uhm, we can't do that because we're sort of self-employed and we'd be lettin' people down but it's different when you're- you know, you get paid anyway whether you turn up or not but good to have you back. Good to have you--
Karl: I'm not a- I'm never off ill.
Ricky: No. Good--
Karl: This is the first time--
Steve: No, I just--
Karl: That I've been off ill at XFM.
Ricky: Well, no, just- just shoot off for two weeks and then you're off--
Steve: No, I just wish I was the kind of person who could let down an audience--
Ricky: I know. Really--
Steve: Of regular listeners.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Yeah, but like I say--
Ricky: Well, no, we spoke to you, you weren't that bad- a cold- you don't go in for a cold. Uh, we were discussing this last night in the pub and, uh, you know, you don't go in for a cold. Uhm, okay then, moving on, what have we got, then? We've got some great songs, I brought--
Karl: It wasn't a cold though.
Ricky: In The Smiths, I brought in Buzzcocks, I brought in Neil Young, I know Steve's got some hip hop.
Steve: Some great hip hop, hooray!
Ricky: Some great Elvis Costello. It's gonna be great. Karl come on, (Taps Desk) concentrate. You've been away three weeks.
Karl: It just annoys me- no, stop sayin' that--
Ricky: W--
Karl: Cuz you're annoyin' me now.
Ricky: Why?... W- what are you gonna do? Go home ill? (Mocking Voice) "Ohh. Ooh, he's annoyed me." "Oh, has he?" "Yeah--"
Steve: (Mocking Voice) "I got a bit of a headache!"
Ricky: (Mocking Voice) "I put on wet jeans, I'm a little bit annoyed."
Karl Mumbles
Ricky: (Mocking Voice) "Can I have some time off but still get paid?" "Yes, of course you can, Karl."
Karl: Steve, right, he called me up, winding me up about this--
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: And, right, I'm- I'm nearly- I'm thirty, right- I'm thirty now--
Ricky Giggles Quietly
Karl: I can only remember being off two times.
Ricky: Oh, his memory's goin' as well. You'll have some time off.
Steve Chuckles
Karl: And both of them were when I- when I was at school. One- one--
Ricky: "Scyull?" What's "scyull"?
Karl: One when it was windy...
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) Why did you have to have off cuz it was windy?
Steve: But, to be honest, Karl, that lasted for seven years--
Ricky: No- no wait- (Laughing) yeah, yeah.
Steve: Your time off at school.
Ricky: Wait, wait, wait, why did you have time off cuz it was windy?
Steve: Were you windy or was it windy outside?
Karl: No, it was a really- it was like when--
Ricky: Your auntie wasn't out the window, was she?
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: When- when the winds were bad in the seventies and me mam said, "Oooh--"
Ricky: What'd you- whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoahhh. I remember space hoppers and flares--
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah.
Ricky: I don't remember the winds being bad in the seventies.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: Well me- me mam just said, uhh, "You might get blown into the road so don't go in."
Ricky Bursts Into Laughter
Ricky: She had so much faith in you, didn't she... as a human being?
Steve: Is that why she got fired from the pie shop?
Ricky Laughs
Steve: "I'm not coming in today, I might get blown into the road."
Ricky: God, they- ohh God.
Karl: The funny thing was, right, Steve, they had this- this thing goin' at school - cuz a lot of kids used to wag it back then, right--
Steve: Used to what?
Karl: Wag it - sort of, not go in.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Right.
Karl: And, ehm, they, sort of, tried to make it interesting for you by giving you a--
Steve: An education?
Karl: A certificate.
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Steve: Right.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Certificate if you did a full week.
Ricky: A reward for the rest of your life--
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Ricky: With achievement. That sort of- that sort of carrot.
Steve: Mm.
Karl: And also, like, let you got home at three o'clock on a Friday--
Ricky: Right.
Steve: Brilliant.
Karl: If you'd done a- like, a full week and that, right.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: So it was a- it was lovely weather all week, then it just, sort of, changed on a Friday--
Ricky Almost Laughs
Karl: And I got off and it was all windy and me mam said--
Ricky: It's always windy on Fridays and Sundays, innit?
Steve: Yeah. Yeah.
Karl: Uhh, "Don't- don't, you know- if you don't want, don't go in cuz you might get blown into the road and that."
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: So I said, "All right then, I'll stay off." And, uhhhm--
Ricky: Sorry, why didn't she... told you held on- hold on to a fence or--
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah.
Ricky: Walk ya there. What's this "don't go out, you might get blown--"
Steve: "Immediately give up."
Ricky: I love this "getting blown into the road". Is that based on your cats that kept gettin' blown into the road?
Karl: Well... So, I got to- got to school on Monday, right, and the teacher said, "Right--"
Ricky: Took you a long time.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: "Today, uh, to punish you - you were the only one who wrecked the whole week, right- everyone else came in, you didn't, so everyone else is going home at three o'clock today... but you're not."
Steve: Brilliant. Serves you right and, uh- and--
Karl: I wasn't bothered though, it was great cuz I said, "Well, you'll have to stay with me, won't ya?"
Steve: Brilliant.
Karl: And it's great. So, all I did for half an hour was doodle and stuff. It was great- little afternoon.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: And that- that was ages ago. That was, like, when I was about... eight. And that's one of the times I was off ill.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: So.. eight--
Steve: But that wasn't even ill, that was wind.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Well, yeah. So...
Steve: Right.
Ricky: Yeah. Yeah, it's a bit different when you're--
Steve: To be honest with you--
Ricky: In the adult world though, Karl. You can't just not turn up because you've got a bit of a cold or you're a bit fed up... I mean, we had an appointment four o'clock Thursday, wasn't it, and he had to call up, he said, "Aw, cancel it", I went on, "meeting went a little bit late."
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: (Tsk Sound) (Banging the Desk on each Word) Time management. Get things done. If it was important, you'd get it done. Play a record, Karl.
Steve: Pull your finger out please.
Song: Elvis Costello - Alison

segment:It Sounds Like the Most Complicated Game Ever

Ricky: Elvis Costello, "Alison". What a great track that is.
Steve: Mm.
Ricky: Beautiful. Well, Karl, we better tell 'em all the new great features we've come up with... in the time... you were off.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: Right, well, we'll, uhh- we've got the film thing still goin'.
Steve: Okay.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Ehhhm...
Ricky: That's where you take a lead role or a m- or a- a major role in a- in a Hollywood blockbuster which we then give away on VHS - worth 6.99.
Steve Giggles
Karl: And, uhh, something new we're trying out cuz "Rockbusters"--
Steve: Is dead thankfully, yes.
Karl: Is, uhh- is gone for a bit.
Steve: It's over.
Karl: Ehhm, "Crosswords".
Steve: "Crosswords".
Ricky: Ooooh, this sounds intrigueing, where'd you get the idea from?
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: What's- what's the basic, uh, format of this?
Karl: Right, what I- what I've done is: I've, uhh--
Ricky: Yeah. Yeah.
Karl: Take- take, like, a- a popular saying from the show...
Steve: A popular what?
Karl: A popular saying, something that crops up quite a lot in the show.
Steve: In our show?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Uhhhm, first thing that spring- sort of, sprang to mind was, uh, "There's this hairy Chinese kid."
Steve: Okay.
Ricky: Oooh, classic.
Steve: But more- more commonly it would be something like "Karl, you're an idiot"--
Ricky: Yeah, "Play a record you ignorant fool"--
Steve: "Karl, you idiot", "Karl, you're a fool"--
Ricky: "Ooh, what do you mean? You let us down again. You should have been here."--
Steve: Yeah, "Karl, where have you been?"
Ricky: "Yeah, you--"
Steve: (Mocking Tone) "Oh, you've got a headache, have you Karl? You better have a lie down."
Ricky: (Mocking Tone) Yeah. Awwwwww!
Steve: Typical phrases like that, sure.
Ricky: Yeah. Typical phrases like that, yeah. Yeah.
Steve: "Karl, you're a loser", yeah.
Ricky: (Mocking Tone) Awww, yeah.
Karl: Right. And, uhm, what I've done, I've got a load of different songs and took words--
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: From the different songs and then joined them together--
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: To make "There's this hairy Chinese kid" and then people have to email in and say what the five songs were.
Steve: It sounds like the most complicated game ever.... I'm looking forward to it. Are you- have you heard any of this, Rick, cuz I've not heard this at all--
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: I'm not familiar with this.
Ricky: Well, all it is, it'll- it'll go, like, (Disjointed Tones) "Hairy. Chi. Nese. Kid." and that's- it's from, sort of, four different songs--
Steve: Right.
Ricky: And you've got to identify the songs.
Steve: Right. Wow!
Ricky: How many songs in this, Karl? You o--
Karl: Five. Five. "There's", "This", "Hairy", "Chinese", "Kid".
Ricky: Okay.
Karl: All right?
Ricky: So...
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) And, uh, what are the prizes for that? Are these the prizes?
Karl: Yeh. Yeh.
Steve: All right, well let me tell you what they are. They're not too bad, actually. We've got, uhm, "Live Forever" which I assume is a CD that ties in with this new film--
Ricky: Think of that... A well-known phrase from the show and it's "Hairy Chinese kid"!
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah.
Ricky: What other- where would you hear that?!
Steve: There is no other radio show in the world--
Ricky: In life. I... this is... Go on.
Steve: If you've just tuned in, I mean, what do you think?
Ricky: What do you think if you've just tuned in? And go, (Slight Manc Accent) "Well-known phrase from show: "Hairy Chinese kid."
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: Aww, yeah... classic.
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: They'll be playing that in charades this Christmas.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Steve: Ah, so, yeah, this is, uh, a CD that ties into this new film "Live Forever" which is all- is all about, uh, Britpop and so there's stuff on there from Oasis, Blur, Pulp, etc. Uh, we've also got, uh, another "Red Dwarf" DVD. Uhh, "Marion and Geoff", the first series of that, excellent--
Ricky Coughs
Steve: It's on VHS, sadly but, uh, nevermind. And, uhmmm- and also "The Very Best of Led Zepplin", a two CD set there with all the classics on. So that's not bad prizes actually, Karl. You've done yourself proud.
Ricky: That is, uh- we've upped it- we've upped it, we're getting serious now. We're playing in the, you know- the bigger league. We've upped the stakes, we want "Heat" magazine not to, you know, lose touch with us just because "Rockbusters" is gone.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: I think they're still behind us. We've got to show the worried--
Steve: So, we've got- we've got, uhh- we've got "Film..."- you appear in a film--
Karl: Mm.
Steve: We've got (Laughing Slightly) "Crosswords." How is that to do with a crossword?
Karl: Because I've got words and, sort of, crossed them.
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Okay.
Ricky: Right. You haven't really crossed them.
Steve Giggles
Ricky: But, uh, good. So, "Words". We're playing a game called, "Words".
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: "Word Song". Hello, and welcome to "Word Song".
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: Brilliant.
Steve: And, uhh- and obviously I imagine there'll be some more great music.
Ricky: But we've got a new feature, haven't we?
Karl: Which one's this?
Ricky: Are we doing... uhm, within the monkey news, the new feature?
Karl: Awwwww, Steve...
Steve: I'm excited. You know "Monkey News" is my favorite feature so what have you added to it?
Ricky: Explain it.
Karl: Right, well, uhhh, there's been loads of stuff going on in the past few weeks, all right? Ehhh, but for the times when I struggle, when- when, sort of, monkeys have had a quiet week...
Ricky and Steve Laugh Slightly
Karl: And- and there isn't that much news goin' on, right--
Steve: Sure.
Karl: Come up with this thing... I, sort of, speak to an expert, I've- I've spoke to him already, right...
Steve: You spoke- you spoke to an expert?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: A monkey expert?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: Uh huh.
Karl: And I ask him a question.
Steve: Wow!
Karl: Right? The feature... it's got a good name, you know that's the way I work.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: "Cheap as Chimps".
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: Right?
Steve: (Laughing) Okay.
Karl: And what I do, I ask them a question about, you know, oooh, how much does it cost to, you know, keep one... how much does it cost to, you know, feed one for a week.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: All this sort of stuff. So, I- I give out, like, a monkey story and if that isn't enough for people, they'll also learn something else at the end of it.
Steve: Right.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: So, like...
Steve: It sounds fascinating, can I say right now.
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: That's just some of the things that we've come up with. Play a record, Karl.
Steve: Please still continue to listen though.
Ricky: Yeah.
Song: Richard Ashcroft - Buy It In Bottles

segment:You're Gonna Need to Maybe Step Down

Ricky: Richard Ashcroft, "Buy It In Bottles" on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Karl Pilkington.
Steve: Karl, I need the phone number of your girlfriend.
Pause
Steve: Let me explain why. I was lucky enough, once again, to be on your quiz team this week. Uhm, uh, Ricky--
Ricky: Still to beat me- he's still to beat me with his team yet.
Steve: We, uh--
Ricky: Second- second I came.
Steve: We, uh- the s- the gang here and some friends, we, uh, sometimes go down to a pub quiz in the local area and, uhm, it was very nice of Karl to be invited on his team. Uh, twice now I've been on that team. Ricky's always on another team. And, uhm, I- (Sighs) what can I say, Karl, I- I- do you mind me saying this now because I've- I've- I've analyzed the team and it's your- very much your team and, uh, you've put the team together, you've recruited some excellent personnel, your girlfriend's, uh, very, very good on the team--
Karl: Yeh.
Steve: As is one of her, uh, work colleagues and, uh, you normally bring in, you know someone like myself. I like to think I'm providing a certain something with the entertainment section, I seem to remember last time, I answered at least six or seven questions that other people hadn't got. So, I- I felt I provided something there. Ehm, Karl, I- I- rather like John Harvey-Jones who used to be called in to, sort of, troubleshoot companies I see why you are not winning ever. And it's a rather pricey, uhh, contest, isn't it? It costs a tenner to enter per person--
Ricky: Each.
Karl: Yeah. Yeah.
Steve: And unless you get in the top three, you're not- you're not gonna get to see your money back. So, uhm--
Ricky: No.
Steve: I think you're gonna maybe need to step down--
Ricky Gasps
Steve: From the team... because Karl, I'm not sure--
Ricky: Ooohhh.
Steve: I am not sure--
Ricky: Awww.
Steve: You- you consider yourself a, kind of, player/manager but frankly I'm not sure you're providing enough.
Karl: Right...
Ricky: See this is- this is funny because... as bad as I imagine you are, I don't think Steve would make it into my team so he's gettin' a bit cocky here. I wanna know what your opinion of him- cuz he's told me he's great on it.
Karl: Well... you're bang out of order, first of all.
Ricky: (Laughing Slighty) OOhhh!
Steve: Okay.
Ricky: He's d--
Ricky Giggles
Karl: Did you have a good night when you were with us?
Steve: Um, I tell you what, I wish I'd- I wish I hadn't lost a tenner everytime I've come down.
Ricky Cackles
Karl: Well--
Steve: That would have improved it.
Karl: Your point out there about the football analogy--
Steve: Mm-hmm.
Karl: Alex Ferguson...
Ricky: Yeh.
Karl: When did he score a goal?
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Right.
Karl: He doesn't, he tells the others how to do it.
Steve: Mm.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Right? That's- that's my role in there--
Ricky: He doesn't take up one of the eleven though, does he?
Steve: No. Exactly.
Ricky: It's not like you can only field ten--
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Because, uh--
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: "We've only got 10 again." (Ferguson Impression) "Alright, I want to be in the eleven."
Steve: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. He's stopped running around in midfield--
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) No. No.
Steve: Fallen over.
Ricky: Yeah, shoutin', (Ferguson Impression) "Aww, what have I told ya?"
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: No.
Karl: Right, I'll admit, right--
Ricky: And there's a limit of five players. We should explain that. That's the point.
Steve: Yeah. There's only five pe- players on the team.
Ricky: The- players- so- so--
Karl: But, it- it was pretty tricky on Tuesday, though, wannit? It was one of the tougher--
Steve: T- t- tell everyone the one question you got right.
Karl: It was something about, uhhh--
Steve: Well, tell us the answer, the two words you had to say to get the answer.
Pause
Karl: Dannii Minogue.
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Dannii Minogue.
Ricky Laughs Quietly
Steve: That was what you provided - Dannii Minogue.
Ricky Chuckles
Ricky: It's as valuable as Dostoevsky--
Steve: Well, no- not- not- really because--
Ricky: Or 1.6--
Steve: Because- because there was at least two of us who also knew the answer.
Ricky: Oh. Well he--
Steve: We- we gave him- we gave him the--
Ricky: He didn't provide anything.
Steve: No, exactly. We gave it to Karl. We- massage his ego. But, uhm...
Ricky: Oh, yeah.
Steve: I just feel, Karl, I--
Ricky: I- I- do you know what? I'm a little- I feel a little bit bad, now cuz I just saw- he had a crushed face on him--
Steve: Can- can I just tell you right now--
Ricky: He just can't believe this.
Steve: Can I just tell you right now, I think the problem is this: I think there's that precious fifth position that is not being filled - at the moment, I think - consistently enough by a decent player. Right, you've got a solid team. I'm thinking if you want to remain on the team you are gonna have to pull your finger out and find a fifth member that is gonna provide- and I'll tell you where the weaknesses are, I can tell you right now, mate. The weaknesses are natural history and science--
Ricky: Aww--
Steve: Something which Ricky Gervais is scoring on week-in and week-out on his team.
Ricky: There is- there is a few science--
Steve: Now, if he was available for a transfer, we could be fine--
Ricky Laughs Quietly
Steve: But we've got to find someone to fill in that space otherwise I'm either gonna quit or you're gonna have to step down because I don't think I can be on a team where--
Ricky: Where he- dare he loses ten pounds--
Steve: Where there are obvious deficiencies- are visible deficiencies on your team.
Ricky: Um, and you know, the ten pounds.
Steve: That's ten pounds - I'm not made of money.
Ricky Giggles
Steve: That's once a month!
Ricky: I've- I've seen him depressed for two hours when he lost twenty pounds at a casino after five hours playing.
Steve: Don't bring it back. Don't bring- don't bring that back.
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Steve: Don't bring up that again, that story.
Ricky: He doesn't like wastin' money, Karl. You know that.
Steve: What do you think? What do you think? What's the solution? You've got to be- (Slapping His Palm) we've got to think proactively, now. We have got to sort this out.
Karl: See, there's always other things going on in me mind when I'm at that pub quiz.
Ricky Snickers
Karl: For me, it's just a little bit of fun--
Steve: Sure.
Karl: It's a night out, do you know what I mean?
Steve: Yeah, uh huh.
Karl: Suzanne enjoys it.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Bit of a get together, we have a chat beforehand--
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: We have a bit of fun.
Ricky: Yeh.
Karl: But there's other things on me mind.
Ricky: What are ya thinkin'?
Steve: Karl, I could do that here, I don't have to lose a tenner.
Ricky: No, wait. Wait, what were you thinking during the quiz, there when the questions were comin' out? What were you thinking of?
Karl: Well, what it was, right... just before the quiz started, I had to go the the toilet, right, because the rule is, right - people who don't go to it - once it starts, phones off--
Ricky: Oh yeah, you can't leave the room, yeah.
Karl: No more toilet. They take it dead serious, don't they, right?
Ricky: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Karl: So, I went to the toilet.... Now, I'm not bein' out of order here, it just got me thinking, right.
Pause
Karl: I went to the toilet... there's a gay fella in there. All right?
Steve: There was a gay fella in there?
Karl: Gay fella in the toilet--
Steve: Okay.
Karl: Now--
Steve: How could you tell?
Ricky: How did you know? How did you know?
Karl: Just typical, you know... everything about it. Right--
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) "It"!
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) "Everything about it". Right. Yeah.
Ricky: Oh!
Steve: What, large handlebar mustache--
Ricky: W- w--
Steve: Leather cap.
Ricky: Butt- butt plugs, ammonitrate- could I just say that... these views do not reflect the views of the management of XFM or me and Steve. Go on. Karl.
Steve: Or most of the people of this country. On you go.
Ricky: Go on- go on, Karl. What's your problem?
Karl: Yeah, but this is what I'm worried about, really- but this is why I only got Danni Minogue right.
Ricky Giggles
Karl: All right? Cuz this was floatin' around me mind. Went to the toilet--
Ricky: She's a big gay icon, isn't she?
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: Now... go into the toilet.. they have- they have, like, men's cubicle and they have women's cubicle...
Ricky: Yeh.
Karl: Now without sounding out of order... is it wrong for me to think...
Ricky Giggles Quietly
Karl: Gay men should have their own little cubicle?
Ricky: (Laughing) Call in!
Steve: They should have their own- well not cubicle, you mean an actual toilet, I suppose.
Karl: Yeah. When I was at the urinal...
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Normally, you know, there's a fella there and you go, "All right?", and there's no pressure.
Ricky Giggles Quietly
Karl: But I couldn't- I couldn't go. I was thinking, "Should I wait? If I go into the toilet, it'll look obvious--"
Ricky Laughs
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: I had loads of pressure and this was going on--
Steve: But what were you worried about?
Ricky: I am so sorry.
Steve: What were you concerned about?
Ricky: I am so sorry, viewers. I am so sorry.
Karl: Well, it's like- right, listen, when I was a kid, right--
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: And it's all right for you to go into women's toilets when you're a kid, it's like, "Oooh, it's a bit cute."
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Right? As long as you're not, like, over fifteen or something, right.
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Right.
Karl: But, when I was a kid I went into the toilet and women, when they use their little cubicles, they don't shut the door. Some of 'em just sit down on the- on the toilet.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Right? And you see everything.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky Howls With Laughter
Karl: No, seriously that's probably one of the first times I saw, like, a woman.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: That, right, and me Auntie Nora when she was stayin' over.
Ricky Wheezes Laughter
Ricky: (Laughing) What happened with your Auntie Nora?
Karl: She was, uhm- she was into wearing kaftans...
Steve: Into wearing what?
Karl: You know, kaftans.
Ricky: Oh, yeah.
Steve: What are kaftans?
Ricky: Big bellowy, sort of, dresses.
Steve: Right, right.
Karl: And, uhh...
Pause
Karl: Yeah, I- I- I used to sit on the floor at home, in front of the telly.
Steve: Sure.
Karl: She was on the chair behind--
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: She did a bit of a- sort of, a Sharon Stone scene--
Steve Laughs Slightly
Steve: Oh God!
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: Did you see it?
Karl: Mm.
Steve: There was no underwear?
Karl: No.
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) What age were you?
Ricky: What was it like?
Pause
Steve: What age were you?
Karl: It was like a ripped tennis ball.
Ricky Bursts With Laughter
Ricky: (Laughing) Play a record!
Steve: WHAT?!
Ice-T - That's How I'm Living Begins To Play
Ricky Laughs
Steve: Right, we're off air. We're off air. Either that or put us in for the Sony's.
Ricky Laughs
Song: Ice-T - That's How I'm Living

segment:I'll Just Hold It In

Steve: Ice T, "That's How I'm Living".
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Bit of old school hip hop.
Ricky: Where's our tea?
Steve: Good point, yeah.
Ricky: Go get me a cup of coffee or sommat.
Steve: Well, before we do that, can I just qualify something? I'm a little bit concerned about your--
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Your toilet discussion. What- what exactly is your point again? I'm just a bit bemused.
Karl: Yeah, but- you see... it's- it's a tricky one. All I'm saying is, right, there I was at the pub quiz, I go to the toilet... not thinking about anything--
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: I try to go, right, there's a little gay fella next to me.
Ricky: (Giggling) I love this little gay fella.
Karl: Now... the weird thing is there's nothing stopping him having a little- little glance, right? Because he's allowed in- in the fella's toilet.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Now I'm not allowed to go into the women's toilet... and have a little- have a little look 'round.
Steve Laughs
Steve: (Laughing) Right.
Ricky Laughs
Karl: So all I'm saying is: should they have another- another toilet area?
Steve: What, for gay people?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: And... so this would be gay men and lesbians?
Karl: Ehhhh...
Steve: Is that gonna complicate things?
Karl: Well--
Ricky: I mean, I can only assume- I mean, to point- a- a- ask you a question, right. If you're intimidated, that's- I mean, that- that- that's a shame but you know most gay men aren't looking at your knob?
Pause
Ricky: You know that?
Pause
Karl: What do you mean?
Ricky: I can only say that 99.9 percent of gay men who use a urinal standing next to, what they assume is a heterosexual man, aren't looking at his knob.
Karl: Well, what are they doing, then?
Ricky: They're- they're emptying their bladder.
Karl: (Not Convinced) Mmm.
Ricky Bursts Into Laughter
Karl: No, but the thing is, you- you--
Ricky: I can't t- I can't talk politics with Karl.
Karl: You're sayin'- you're sayin', like, you know, about "would you have one toilet for lesbian women and gay fellas?", right.
Ricky: Well, what does that mean? Would it be mixed or would it just be--
Karl: Well, it's--
Ricky: Would it have a- would it have a man on one - that's for heterosexual men, a little picture of a woman on the other and... then what? What would (Laughing Slightly) the little icon be?
Steve: Two- a man and a woman.
Ricky: A man and a woman.
Steve: Just havin' a chat.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: In pink and Doc Martens.
Karl: Well, y- you couldn't mix 'em because then, what would happen is, you'd get people who- who are goin', "Ah, I'll play- I'll play up to this a bit--"
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: What, pretend to be gay?
Karl: And yeah, n- you know, sort of, grow a mustache and shave their head...
Ricky: And pretend to be a lesbian?
Steve Giggles
Ricky Giggles
Steve: (Laughing) Right... Yeah... So- so, I see- so people are pretending to be gay so they can go in and look at the lesbians.
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: Right. So, that would mean that we need four cubicles now, would we?
Ricky: Yeah, no, this is fine - four cubicles is fine--
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) So- so, every pub now--
Ricky: How many toilets do we need at the moment?
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Every pub has now got four toilets.
Ricky: Oh, Karl, bisexuals!
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah! Now- interesting--
Ricky: (Comical Tone) Bisexuals! How many toilets do we need nowww?
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: (Comical Tone) Call the council!
Karl: They u- they use any.
Ricky: Uh?
Karl: No.
Ricky: No.
Steve: No, because they're interested in everything, aren't they?
Ricky: Because the little bisexual fella will be looking at your... knob.
Karl: Right, with them--
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: What you do - you just have a door, you open it and there's one urinal there. So you can't get a queue... They have to- they have to, sort of, wait--
Ricky: I just thougth o- well, why can't there just be a thing between the urinals? So anyone- no one can look at anyone else's knob... full stop.
Steve: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just to go back to Ricky's point... What stops- even if we've got the toilet for gay men, what stops the gay men who want to have a look at your willy going in the regular toilet and pretending that they're straight?
Ricky: Yeah, most men don't wear--
Steve: Who's going to police this?
Ricky: "Gay" across their head--
Steve: No, exactly.
Ricky: They don't have a tattoo- there's no branding yet (Laughing Slightly) in the British Isles where they have to declare--
Steve: So, we're gonna have to expand this so we've all got to carry- carry identity cards--
Ricky: What do you- do you- do you know it- you can see a gay, can ya, coming a mile off?
Karl Exhales
Ricky: No?
Karl: Nah, I'll just hold it in next time.
Ricky: No, no, no, can you tell gay men? Do you know a gay man?
Karl: I'd say, uhhh... probably... If you did, like, a- if you lined some people up--
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And said, "Point 'em out", I reckon I'd get--
Ricky: But hold on, we're not talking about people dressed in leather with the ass cut out and a handlebar mustache--
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: We're talking about... you know, the everyday non-scene--
Karl: No, of course, yeah--
Ricky: A- yeah, but I mean- supposing I put you in a room and there was ten naked men... right.
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: And, uh, could you- there's five gay men and five heterose- could you walk along that line looking at those gay--
Karl: Am I naked?
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) No, you don't have to be naked. Why would you have to be naked?
Karl: To catch 'em out.
Ricky Wheezes with Laughter and Stomps Around the Room
Ricky: (Laughing) Play a record!
The Thrills - One Horse Town Begins to Play
Steve: How would you catch them out?
Karl: Because some of 'em--
Ricky: (Laughing) No, don't go into it! Don't go into it! Don't got into it. Play a record.
Song: The Thrills - One Horse Town

segment:There's This Hairy Chinese Kid

Ricky: The Thrills, "One Horse Town" on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Now, Karl Pilkington is getting ready, it's the start of a new strand in the show, a new quiz, a new competition to replace "Rockbusters". Now that's quite a tall order but...
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: What have you done?
Karl: Right, like I said, right, if you've only just tuned in, what it is - I've took, and I'll be takin', a well known sayin' every week from the show - something that crops up a lot - uhh, first one that sprang to mind... was...
Ricky: "There's a little gay fella standin' next to me in the urinal"?
Karl: That's next week.
Ricky: Okay.
Karl: This week: "There's this hairy Chinese kid." Right?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: That's cropped up quite a lot.
Ricky: It's sweepin' the nation.
Karl: Right, so what I've done, I've got five songs...
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And I've edited them together to make that sayin'.
Ricky: You've got words- you've- from- from songs where any part of that sentence occurs--
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: To recreate it--
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: Now, what do they need to do? Do they need to say what the song is? Just the five songs?
Karl: I mean I- I was gonna say song and artist but if you want, just the song.
Ricky: So fi- there's five things there and if someone doesn't get all five, it's still worth emailing in because we might give it to the one who's got the most and then--
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: Uhh--
Steve: Can I suggest, uhh, we go for artists rather than song only because sometimes it's quite tricky to get a song title, sometimes it's a more- it's very odd or it's not quite what you think it is. So maybe artist is a- is an easier one.
Ricky: It's y- are you happy with that, Karl? It's your competition.
Steve: Is that all right?
Karl: I mean, Steve always does this, whenever I come up with an idea.
Ricky: Oooh yeah!
Steve: I'm just tryin' to make sure it's just the best it can be, Karl.
Karl: Mmm, yeah.
Ricky: Yeah, no, you came up with a few gameshows and Steve was going, "No, it's no good." and Karl said to me, he said, "It's a wonder 'The Office' ever got on telly."
Steve: Yeah, but- well, we shall see how "Cheap as Chimps" plays out but, frankly, the fact that--
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Steve: The fact that you said to me, "Steve, I've come up with the best gameshow ever, it's called 'Cheap as Chimps'" "What's the idea?" "I don't know, I just like the name... it has something to do with chimps." I thought, "Well, I'm not sure that's the best- the best gameshow ever."
Ricky: Well, I--
Steve: And what was the other one you came up with and told me about?
Ricky: I think a few people will be disagreeing with him, Karl. I think people will say that "Cheap as Chimps" could be the best gameshow ever.
Steve: You know, when I was at school, people like you, I really didn't like. You're a stirrer, Gervais. He flips, doesn't he, from one side to the next, Karl. One thing, we may argue, mate, but at least we're consistent. Ricky Gervais flippin' from one side to the other. One day he's on Karl's side--
Ricky: Karl, when was the last time Steve wrestled you to the ground and got you in a leg clamp?
Karl: No, you're right.
Ricky: Never.
Steve: What? Is- is that supposed to be a good thing?
Ricky: Well, didn't you see us?
Steve: Yeah, I saw you struggling in the- (Laughs Slightly) in Karl's office, earlier.
Ricky: He was punching my legs to release him. We were on the floor and I was squeezing him with my mighty legs, wasn't I Karl?
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: It was like- I imagine that's what a crab feels like when an octopus has got it.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: We were playing that, weren't we?
Karl: So, anyway--
Ricky Cackles
Karl: So, I'll play this clip. Now, it's ten seconds long, we'll play it a couple of times cuz you'll need to take it in.
Steve: Mm hmm.
Karl: Ehh, so here it is, then... Eh, what are we sayin'? We're saying artists?
Steve: Let's go with artists.
Karl: Artists. So, email in ricky.gervais@xfm.co.uk. Name the fa- five artists it has taken to make up the saying "There's this hairy Chinese kid".
Ricky: Give that email address again. Give that email address again.
Karl: Ricky.gervais@xfm.co.uk, all right?
Ricky: "There's this hairy Chinese kid."
Karl: Here you go.
THERE'S. This. Hare. Chiiii-neeeeeese. Kid!
Ricky and Steve Giggle
Karl: Play it again?
Steve: Yeah, play it again.
Karl: Here you go.
THERE'S. This. Hare. Chiiii-neeeeeese. Kid!
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Steve: I think you better play it once more.
Karl: All right.
Ricky: Ahhh! Got 'em- I've got 'em!
Steve: Have you got 'em all?
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: That's nice work.
Karl: Here we go.
THERE'S. This. Hare. Chiiii-neeeeeese. Kid!
Karl: There you go.
Steve: I should just remind you now - that the prizes include a, uh, "Red Dwarf" DVD, "Marion and Geoff", the first series of that on VHS, uh, a "Live Forever" Britpop CD and also "The Very Best of Led Zep- Led Zeppelin". Let's play one of those, actually, while we're here.
Ricky: Brilliant.
Steve: "Rock and Roll".
Song: Led Zeppelin - Rock and Roll

segment:ZX81 With No RAM Pack

Steve: One of the prizes on Karl's competition this week is "The Very Best of Led Zeppelin". That's obviously "Rock and Roll". Uh, we've also got a "Live Forever" Britpop CD, "Marion and Geoff" and "Red Dwarf". And, uh, should we play it again so people have got another chance?
Ricky: "There's this hairy chinese kid".
Karl: Yeh.
Steve: Who are the artists?
Karl: Here we go.
THERE'S. This. Hare. Chiiii-neeeeeese. Kid!
Ricky and Steve Laugh Slightly
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) It's tricky. It's not very easy. Once more.
Karl: One more.
THERE'S. This. Hare. Chiiii-neeeeeese. Kid!
Ricky: Well--
Steve: Well, hard.
Ricky: There you go. Email in.
Steve: Ricky.gervais@xfm.co.uk. Those prizes can be yours.
Karl: Mm.
Steve: I, uh, at the quiz also discovered, of course, and, uhm- I don't know, I'm just intrigued to know, Karl- I'm just intrigued to know, uhmm.. It was your girlfriend's birthday wasn't it? Earlier in the week?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: Or last week?
Karl: On Monday, yeah.
Ricky: What'd you get?
Steve: And, uhm, obviously it was a triumph, the stuff you got her for Christmas. Uhh--
Ricky: The condoms.
Steve: The box- the box of condoms.
Ricky: Box set- box set of condoms.
Steve: And- (Laughing) oh, yeah.
Ricky: Not just- not just the singles--
Steve: (Laughing) Exactly.
Ricky: The whole- the whole set.
Steve: Yeah, a complete collection.
Ricky: Brilliant.
Steve: So what'd you go for this time?
Ricky: What'd you get her?
Pause
Karl: Yeah, but--
Ricky: No, no, no, no, no, no, no--
Steve: "Yeah but..."
Ricky: No "yeah but", it's her birthday. How long have you been together?
Karl: About nine years.
Ricky: Okay so... oooh, God it must cost you so much on her birthday!
Karl: No, but it starts gettin' tricky, dunnit, cuz I spoiled her a lot.
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: In the first few years.
Steve: (Laughing) Yeah.
Karl: So then you start--
Steve: "Here's a packet of rubber bands. Enjoy them."
Ricky: Yeah. Awwww.
Karl: Well, she- it's what she wanted.
Ricky: Okay.
Karl: And you're makin' out as if--
Ricky: No, everyone wants paper clips!
Steve Chuckles Slightly
Ricky: Come on, what did you get her?
Karl: Got her a- a new pair of gloves.
Steve: Right.
Ricky: All right, well...
Steve: And?
Ricky: What, a nice- nice leather ones from Salfridge's or Harrods or sommat?
Karl: Uh, they were good ones, the sort she likes. So... They weren't--
Ricky: Oh, they we- they weren't the little woollen ones that she had?
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: I thought that was a joke when she said, "He got me these", cuz I laughed.
Pause
Karl: No, that's- but I know that's- the- the ones she did have, the--
Ricky: When she said it was her birthday, right- it was her birthday Monday, and me and Steve w- "Oh, what did you get her?", and she went, "He got me these", cuz she had those little woollen gloves on, I laughed... cuz I thought she was joking, Karl.
Steve Chuckles
Karl: It's what she wanted.
Steve: Right.
Karl: I've told ya before about buyin' presents, it's- it's--
Steve: Do those gloves have your name sewn in them?
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Steve: And a piece of string... that ran over the back of your duffle coat?
Karl: You know I've never been into gettin' presents and that. I had the problem at that Christmas one time with the Victoria Plum--
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Right?
Steve: Yeah. We'd hate that--
Karl: We've--
Steve: We'd hate to bring that back.
Karl: We've done that. And the--
Steve: Cuz we've talked about that before- cuz it's kind of to do with your dad, is it? He's a very bad gift buyer, was that the problem?
Karl: Well, yeah, me dad's- I mean, me dad just wouldn't bother. It- it was me mam who, sort of, made an effort and she, sort of, worked out half of what I wanted, then she left it to me dad to get someone- see if he could get one cheap or whatever.
Steve: What--
Ricky: I- I love the fact that usually people talk about, like, drinking heavily--
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Or, uhm, uh, violent abuse, right?
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: But, his- what he's been left with and scarred with for- for parents is bad gift buying.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: That's not bad, is it?
Steve: And the Victoria Plum incident.
Ricky: In the greater scheme of things in the world--
Karl: Yeah, but--
Ricky: That's not a bad thing to have, is it?
Steve Chuckles
Karl: Right, there was this- there was this- this is what it's like about gettin' presents and stuff, right...
Ricky: Uh huh.
Karl: With me- with me mam and dad.
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: Me mate Colin, right, he had, uh--
Ricky: Colin Makin?
Karl: No, Colin Bailey.
Ricky: Oh, yeah.
Karl: Right? He had a, uh, little, uh, Sinclair Spectrum, right?
Ricky: Yeh.
Karl: Computer.
Ricky: Yeh.
Karl: Which was, like, the- the thing to have at that time, right?
Ricky: Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Karl: Used to always go around to his house. The deal was--
Ricky: Not the one where you had to play through the window because you weren't allowed in--
Karl: No, no, no, that's another lad, right.
Ricky: Ah, yeah.
Karl: This is- this is a different lad and the deal was: he came to our house and me mam gave him a pie...
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: And then I'd go 'round to his and I'd stay there for a few hours playing, you know, "Hungry Horace" and stuff like that on it.
Ricky and Steve Giggle
Karl: Right? Now, me mam and dad knew that I really wanted one of these... computers, right. So I waited about a year... Came 'round to Christmas Day, I thought, "I reckon, uh, I might have one."... Turned out, they bought me the wrong one... they bought me a ZX81 instead of a Spectrum--
Steve Inhales in Horror
Karl: And Christmas Day, I'm there trying to load the games up, it's not working, I'm thinking, "What's wrong?!", right. And the thing with me when I was a kid, I used to get quite, sort of, agitated quite easy--
Steve: This is the- this is the moment.
Karl: Right? I found out, that you needed a RAM pack to make it work... right... Lookin' in the thing and it's saying, "And make sure you put your RAM pack in the back". And I was like, "Awww... where's the RAM pack?" And me dad's goin', "I don't know, I've got you the main bit. That's- that's it."... So, I was that wound up, I just was sick, right--
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: Just sick. I w- I didn't feel sick or anything, I just was like, "Oh, God!", went to the sink, just- just sick.
Ricky Continues Laughing
Karl: Cuz I was that on edge about it.
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: I said, "Come on, we've gotta get one", and me dad's like, "Tandy's shut. We're not gonna- we're not gonna get anything today."
Ricky Continues Laughing
Karl: Ruined again, Christmas Day. That was after the year when me train set got blown up by our kid. The following year - no RAM pack. And now you ask me why I don't get good presents.
Ricky Continues Laughing Quietly
Steve: (Laughing) He's scarred. You just- just threw up.
Ricky: I'm gonna die. Honestly, I'm gonna die. (Laughing) Just being sick.
Steve: Yeah. "There's no RAM pack?! (Vomit Sound)"
Ricky Laughs
Ricky: Why wasn't- did you get to the bottom of it? Why wasn't there a RAM pack?
Karl: You have to buy them seperate.
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) Oh, okay.
Steve: "What do you mean I can't play 'Frogger'?! (Vomit Sound)"
Ricky Laughs
Ricky: Oh no!
Steve: So, uhm, wasn't there another incident when you threw up? Spontaneously threw up.
Karl: Ohhh.
Steve: Through sheer anxiety.
Karl: I- I do get it- it's not so much now cuz I've- I've relaxed a bit but as a kid I used to be quite on edge all the time with certain things.
Ricky: Do you think that's what happened with your cat bein' sick?
Steve: The wind.
Ricky: That it didn't get the food it wanted and it just threw up. Do you remember that?
Steve: Yeah, yeah.
Ricky: God. So they shaved it.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: Yeah, but again, you see, the cat thing... I mean, it's mad, I was thinking about it the other day, right- I used to think I had quite a normal upbringing.
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) You didn't.
Karl: Right. And someone was talkin' about the cat--
Steve: Your mother once told you not to go to school because it was windy, Karl!
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: It was not a normal upbringing.
Ricky: The cat was bein' sick so she shaved it, so it was easier to clean.
Steve Giggles
Karl: Right, well me mam and dad went on holiday, right--
Steve: Uh huh.
Karl: And I stayed at the Ross', down the road...
Ricky and Steve: Oh yeah.
Karl: Only a kid - must of been about 5 or something, right?
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: And, uhh, I was always runnin' around in the house, I had a lot of energy as a kid.
Ricky Stifles Laughter
Karl: What the Ross' did - they had this cat that was dead violent, the most violent, sort of, angry cat I have ever witnessed--
Ricky: (Laughing) I love this!
Steve: A tiger!
Karl: It was- honestly Steve... if it was bigger, it would have been cuz it was just always havin' a go at ya.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: If you went to pat it on the head, it went to bite ya and stuff and what they used to do with it to stop me runnin' around- I'd, sort of, be runnin' around and I'd get a bit tired, and they'd say, "Have a lie down on the settee." So, I'd- I'd lie down on the settee and I'd nod off and what they used to do- I'd wake up and they'd have put the cat on me belly.
Ricky and Steve Laugh Slightly
Karl: Right. So, I'd be scared to move cuz it's like, "It's gonna get me."
Ricky: But it would keep you... there.
Karl: Right, it kept me there and it used to, sort of, slobber on me and they'd, sort of, go out or whatever and I'd be lying there... That's not normal, is it?
Ricky Laughs Quietly
Steve: Karl, sorry, were you created by the Brothers Grimm for one of their fairy tales? What kind of life is that?!
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: I know.
Ricky: A- a cat paperweight to keep Karl in place.
Steve: (Laughing) Yeah, exactly.
Ricky: "He keeps blowing around, it's windy." "We'll have to weight him down!" "Be caref-" Your mum probably told 'em, "It's a windy you gotta keep something heavy on him, otherwise he just gets blown into the road." God!
Steve: Bless him. Karl, let's just hear your, uh- your thing once more--
Karl: One more time.
Steve: Give people a final chance.
Karl: All right, here we go.
THERE'S. This. Hare. Chiiii-neeeeeese. Kid!

Song: The Strokes - Someday

segment:They Found a Load of Monkeys Somewhere

Song: Red Hot Chili Peppers - Can't Stop
Ricky: (Smooth DJ Voice) Oohhh, those chili peppers are quite hot! "Can't Stop", XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington.
Karl: All right?
Ricky: Karl, you know what- you know what the time is. BONGG--
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: "Monkey News".
Karl: Yeah.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: Uhhh... Right...
Steve: Imagine if Trevor McDonald started like this.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: There's- there's been a lot of stuff going on and that... with monkeys.
Steve: Oh, yeah.
Karl: I've also- I was mentioning earlier how we're, sort of, making a groature- the groat- the feature grow a bit.
Steve: Uh huh.
Karl: All right? So I'm thinking...
Ricky Laughs Quietly
Karl: Oh, I haven't told ya, Steve, either! I've actually been asked to write a thing about monkeys.
Steve: A poem? A what?
Karl: No, no for a magazine called, uh, something "apes".
Steve: Right.
Karl: They want me to--
Ricky: ???
Karl: They want me to do, uhh, like, a column, 500 words about--
Steve: About- about monkeys?
Karl: Anything I want on monkeys. Anything.
Steve: What are you gonna write?
Karl: Don't know, I've... you know, think about it and--
Ricky: Well, give him a typewriter, he'll come up with (Laughing Slightly) the complete works of Shakespeare eventually.
Steve: Yeah. Yeah.
Ricky Giggles
Karl: But anyway--
Steve: You could write about that. Why don't you write about that? You don't- the fact that you don't believe it... You don't believe that an infinite number of monkeys--
Ricky: Because- because- cuz--
Steve: Could type the works of Shakespeare.
Ricky: Because you reckon that most of 'em hadn't read Shakespeare so they wouldn't know the- some of the spellings.
Steve: Exactly.
Karl: It wouldn't happen.
Ricky: Ya idiot, get on with it.
Steve and Karl: All right--
Karl: The, uh- there's been a few things but one that springs to mind... is, uh... they found a load of monkeys somewhere. All right?
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: This is brilliant.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: I mean imagine this- if this was the news.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: Uhhh...
Ricky: Where?!
Pause
Steve: Somewhere.
Karl: Think it was in, uhh...
Ricky: Seventeenth century?
Pause
Karl: Uhhhhhh... I don't- it doesn't matter, that bit, right...
Steve: Okay.
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: Found a load of monkeys--
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: That are, uh, havin' a good chat.
Ricky Laughs
Ricky: (Laughing) G- go on.
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) They're having a good chat. All right.
Ricky: What do you mean?
Karl: They found monkeys that can talk...
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Ehhhm, about- they've worked out they've got about 534 different words that they're using... to, like, have a chat about stuff.
Steve: More than you.
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Ricky: Yeah, what do they chat about, then?
Karl: Just, you know, things that monkeys are worryin' about.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: Just... you know, "Where'd you get that from?" Uhhh--
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: You know--
Steve: "Who does you hair?"
Ricky Laughs
Ricky: "You're goin' out with her again, are ya?"
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: "Ooh, yeah." So--
Steve: "Have you seen that, uh--"
Ricky: Sorry, you can't just leave that!
Steve: No, no, no, I'm just intrigued- I'm just intrigued to know what else. Is there any--
Karl: No, I mean, that- that was--
Steve: Were they discussing the "humanzee"? "Did you see that program on Channel 5?"
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: "He can walk upright."
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: That was good, wannit?
Steve: "Did you see how human he was?"
Ricky: But, I mean, what- what do you mean? They taught them- they taught- they taught themselves this language?
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: Where? Where is this? In the wild, is this, is it?
Karl: Ehhm--
Ricky: Not sign language but--
Karl: It's in some jungle somewhere. They found these monkeys- they heard some, you know- some explorer was over there cutting through the- the woods and that--
Ricky: And he heard his name--
Karl: Heard some--
Ricky: And he thought, "That's-" he went, "What do you want, Ronnie?", he went, "It wasn't me, I didn't say--"
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: "I didn't say, 'Oy, Snodgrass where'd you get that gun?'"
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah exactly.
Ricky: "Well I- well... there's only me and you here."
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Karl: It's weird, innit?
Ricky: No, it's not weird, it's not true.
Karl: Well--
Ricky: Right, come on, then. What's next?
Karl: Once again- but what I'm think- well, I mean, that did happen--
Ricky: So, well--
Karl: Uhhhm, and to, sort of, add to that feature...
Ricky: Th- that's not true.
Karl: We're doin', uhh, "Cheap as Chimps".
Steve: Right. Can I just say now to the audience, if you thought that "Rockbusters" was bad, if you thought that that piece of rubbish earlier about the Chinese hairy kid was- was bad, I- I'm suspecting this is gonna be really not very good at all. I don't- I'm not- I'm just pointing the finger- I--
Ricky: What do you think of him? What do you think of his negativity, Karl? And- and- just based--
Karl: He just keeps- he keeps doin' it.
Steve: I just don't think you should start with the name of the quiz first! This is my c- this is my only concern... You- you- you come up with "Cheap as Chimps" and (Laughing Slightly) now you're trying to construct a game around that.
Karl: We'll see who--
Steve: And I'm not sure it's a proper- well, okay, let's- what is the game? Let's hear it.
Karl: Right, it's about, uhhh, a chimp... right?
Steve: Surprising.
Karl: Ehh, spoke to an expert about 'em.
Ricky Laughs Quietly
Karl: Ehhhm--
Steve: Who was the expert?
Karl: Someone at London Zoo.
Steve: Okay.
Karl: Ehhhmm, how many bananas... do you think the little chimp that they've got at London Zoo eats a day?
Ricky and Steve Laugh Slightly
Steve: Right.
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Steve: How many bananas does a little chimp at London Zoo eat--
Ricky: Is this- can they call in for this?
Karl: I- I'd leave it. I'm just testin' it out on Steve because we've already got an email thing goin' on here.
Steve: So how many bananas do they eat a day? One chimp, per day, how many bananas?
Karl: Yep.
Steve: How many bananas does a chimp eat a day? And does this mean that- cuz sometimes I've seen them on telly- they'll just peel one, they'll eat a bit of it and then throw it away - we're talking about a whole banana?
Karl: How many bananas does it eat a day?
Ricky Giggles
Ricky: (Giggling) Gettin' angry!
Steve: Uhm, how many bananas do you eat a day?
Ricky: (Giggling) Gettin' angry. Come on.
Karl: Well, I'll- I'll try and have two if I've got time--
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Okay.
Karl: But I'm pretty busy.
Steve: Well, I'll go--
Ricky Cackles with Laughter
Steve: Swingin' on your tire?
Ricky Continues Laughing
Karl: How many- how many do you reckon?
Steve: I- I think, uhh, a little monkey, tiny little monkey, per day, (Laughs Slightly) uhh, over the course of a day, I reckon he probably eats fifteen bananas.
Karl: All right, Ricky what are you goin' for?
Pause
Karl: Little chimp at London Zoo.
Ricky: But, hold on- but presumably they don't only feed it bananas...
Karl: Okay.
Ricky: So it's- so it's- so the question is--
Steve: It's "How many bananas does it eat?" Come on, Rick!
Ricky: Yeah, but how many does it get given?! It would eat fifteen if it was given fifteen but it might be given, uh, one slice of banana, fifteen oranges, two hundred potatos and some lettuce!
Steve: How many bananas does it eat? Come on!
Ricky: Five.
Steve: Have a guess.
Karl: Five?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Right... It's only one.
Ricky: Yeah, cuz it only gets given one.
Karl: Cheap as chimps!
Pause
Steve: What?!
Karl: So, it's pretty cheap to have a chimp.
Ricky: Right, I--
Steve Laughs
Ricky: I'm on your side now, Steve.
Steve: I don't understand what happened then! What- so, at the end of it you always shout, "Cheap as chimps!"?
Ricky Laughs
Steve: (Laughing) Is that- what- that's the quiz, is it?!
Ricky: Aw, play a record, Karl.
Steve: Wait a minute. So, is that it? Is that seriously it?
Ricky: Is that it? Was that- was that the first installment of "Cheap as Chimps"?
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: We'll have to see what the press say about this.
Steve: And- and, uhm- and why does it only eat one banana, cuz it only get's given one banana?
Karl: I think that's all it wants.
Ricky: No!
Steve: So you don't even know! You didn't even bother to ask--
Ricky: No, it wouldn't- it wouldn't just get given one banana and nothing else, it would get given a banana and lots of other stuff like apples, oranges, carrots- it would get given a balanced diet.
Steve: Cigars.
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) Yeah.
Karl: Anyway...

Steve: Yeah. Yeah.
Ricky: Bill Withers.
Steve: Nice.
Ricky: All right?
Steve: Cheers. Uhm, and, uhh, the- so I'm not talking about- I'm not talking about, uhmm, "Cheap as Chimps", that--
Ricky: That's safe. That's gonna run and run!
Steve: That's- that's- yeah--
Ricky: That is gonna run and run.
Steve: That- that's really got legs!
Ricky: I- we're- I am gonna check the press, Monday. I can only assume it's a triumph.
Steve Laughs
Steve: (Laughing) Exactly. Another Pilkington triumph.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: I'm gonna give the prize, if you don't mind, Karl, to Karen and Jeff Gilean because they're the only one that got- they were the only couple that got, uh, the second answer which was very, very tricky--
Ricky: But they got four, did they?
Steve: But they only got four right.
Ricky: But four was the top answer so should we give the answers now?
Steve: So, play it Karl and then tell us who each one is.
Karl: All right.
THERE'S. This. Hare. Chiiii-neeeeeese. Kid!
Karl: So there ya go--
Ricky: I didn't know the second one.
Steve: Play it again.
Karl: "There's this hairy Chinese kid."
THERE'S.
Steve: So, the first one The Lars.
Karl: The Lars.

Karl: No.
Ricky: That's Philip Bailey.
Kid!
Ricky: And that's Deacon Blue.
Karl: Right. So it was- it was The Lars--
Ricky: Yeah, what's the second one?
Karl: Strokes.
Steve: Ohhh, that was very tricky.
Ricky: That is hard.
Karl: George Harrison for "hairy"--
Ricky: Harrison, yeah.
Karl: That's all I could get. It was "Hare".
Ricky: "Hare Krishna", yeah.
Steve: Brilliant.
Karl: Uh, no. Uhh, "Chinese": Phil Bailey.
Steve: Uh huh.
Ricky: "Chinese Wall" it is.
Karl: Yeah. And Deacon Blue "Real Gone Kid".
Ricky: "Real Gone Kid", yeah.
Karl: "There's this hairy Chinese kid."
Steve: Very, very hard.
Ricky: Yeah. I love the fact that the normal bit of that, right- the normal bit is, like, the well-known phrase "There's this hairy Chinese kid".
Steve: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Ricky: Like... nothing happened there. That's normal.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: "There's this hairy Chinese kid" as a phrase that often- in fact, you're right, we must have said that phrase twenty times today.
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: What- when was the last time that was said twenty times?
Steve: Never. I don't think it's ever been said anywhere.
Ricky: "There's this hairy Chinese kid". I d- I mean--
Steve: Even in China!
Ricky: I don't think it's e- well, it's very rare in Ch--
Karl: Definitely not said in China.
Ricky Bursts with Laughter
Karl: The prizes they've won?
Steve: The prizes they've won: "Red Dwarf" DVD, "Live Forever" the best of Britpop, "Marion and Geoff" on VHS and "The Best of Led Zeppelin". "Well done" to Karen and Jeff Gilean.

Song: Alpinestars - Burning Up
Ricky: Alpinestars, "Burning Up" on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Karl Pilkington. Steve, you were out of the room, there.
Steve: Mm hmm.
Ricky: Karl took a phone call from someone.
Steve: Okay.
Ricky: He's found a cellmate.
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Right.
Ricky: Not a soulmate, I think one day they will be cellmates...
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) Yes.
Ricky: Because he's just like- he loves everything Karl loves and he was telling Karl stuff and Karl's face was lighting up.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: He told him of two Russian kids in the circus. They were covered in hair and their mum tells them off cuz they were covered in fleas--
Steve Laughs
Ricky: Karl said, "See that annoys me again, innit. They just- they do something else." and the bloke went, "Yeah, they should just make money out of bein' hairy."
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: Karl went, "Exactly!" and the- and he said, "Have you heard of the one- the three-legged juggler?" and the bloke went, "No, what's that?", he went, "That annoys me as well." Because he thinks they shouldn't of done jugglin', they should have done football.
Steve Giggles
Karl: Do you know what I mean though, Steve?
Steve: What do you mean a three-legged juggler? What are you talking about?!
Karl: There's a famous three-legged juggler.
Ricky: Awww, he's mega-famous!
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: He's like the Beckham of wherever he's from!
Steve Chuckles
Karl: But the other day I was lookin' in, I don't know, "Bizarre Magazine" or something, right. And there was this fella who, uhh- he had no arms... Uhh, so you saw a picture of him. His job was fixin' watches - did it with his feet.
Pause
Steve Chuckles Slightly
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: Well, it's just- why pick the most- hardest job to do when you haven't got any hands.
Ricky and Steve Laugh Slightly
Karl: Crush grapes.
Ricky Howls With Laughter
Karl: Or...
Ricky Laughs and Claps
Karl: Do you know what I mean? That- that annoys me.
Ricky: Ohhhh! "Crush grapes"! Imagine him bein' told that at the--
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: He comes in to the- uh, uh, careers advisory, they- they go, "Now, uhh, what do you want to do, Hargreaves?" "Uh, make watches." "Right, take a look at your arms. Crush grapes, mate."
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: "Sorry?" "You're a grape crusher. Next!"
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: Brilliant. Brilliant. I would love you to be a career advisory i- in some, sort of... clinic. It'd be brilliant.
Karl: Well...
Steve: I love the fact that it annoys you. Here's a man, he's got no arms, he has learned to fix watches with his feet--
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: An incredible talent, an incredible skill, he's utilizing that brilliantly, that's annoying to you. You are angered by it.
Karl: Rght, I'm- I'm only being honest. Now you be honest, right? Your watch is broke, who would you go to?
Ricky Laughs Quietly
Karl: You're in a rush. You need it fixed and in a rush.
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Karl: Now, you need some fresh wine...
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Steve: "Be honest..."
Ricky: Ahhh, Karl, you're amazing.
Karl: But, what's this thing that you've been talkin' about? This video?
Ricky: "Freaks". Right, it was a thing that was banned for, like, fifty years. Ehh, I think it's been taken off again but I don't know why- if it's just been deleted. Right, I- I- this is a quest, if anyone out there has got a copy of "Freaks" on DVD or VHS, can Karl borrow it, please? I just- I mean, I almost want to set up a camera to see him watchin' it. Ehm, it's absolutely real, they use people in the circus of the time - I think it was the '20s or '30s and depression - and there's- there's people- there's coneheads, there's a bearded lady - all genuine - there's a bloke they call "The Human Slug" who's got no arms and no legs, Karl, and he's just there and he rolls a cigarette and lights it... with his mouth.
Pause
Karl: I think I've seen his brother...
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: Who isn't called "The Human Slug"... he's called "The Pillow".
Ricky and Steve Giggle
Steve: (Laughing) Right. How does he make a living?
Ricky Continues Giggling
Karl: He, uh...
Ricky Continues Giggling
Ricky: (Laughing) Does anyone want to meet Karl for money?
Steve Laughs Slightly
Ricky: Do you know what I mean? I like that--
Karl: The annoying thing was, right, there was a picture of him, I was gonna put it on our--
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) "I think I've seen his brother".
Karl: I've- on our website, we've- we've put things up like this, right. If you go to ricky.gervais@xfm.co.uk/--
Ricky: What, you put things like that on my website?! It's nothing to do with me. I want people to know that that website is not kept or looked at by me. So, I don't- what have you put on there?!
Karl: There's a fella on there who's known as "The Pillow".
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Ricky: (Laughing) God!
Karl: And he's- you see, I get a bit worried with things like this cuz we're not, sort of, havin' a go or anything, it's just things that--
Ricky: Fascinate you.
Karl: Fascinate me. Yeah. And, uhhm- yeah, it's a guy- it might- it might be the same sort of thing- what's your one called?
Ricky: I bet you used to stare at people with goiters, didn't you, when you were little... in Tescos?
Karl: Well, just go- go to xfm.co.uk/ricky, it is.
Ricky: What's the worst thing you've ever seen on, like, a human face?
Karl: You know- you know what it is and that--
Ricky: What is it?
Karl: I don't want to talk about it.
Ricky: I can't remember.
Karl: Well--
Ricky: Have you told me?
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: What is it?
Karl: But go to the- go to the--
Ricky: It's not the elephant lady that you...?
Karl: Yeh.
Ricky: Is it the elephant lady? You've talked about that on air.
Karl: Well, don't want to talk about it again. Go to the website and see "The Human Pillow".
Ricky Giggles
Karl: A--
Steve: Why is he a human pillow?
Karl: That's what annoyed me, I thought he was more of a draught excluder.

Buzzcocks - "Harmony In My Head" Begins to Play
Ricky and Steve Laugh
Steve: Aw, that breaks all kinds of rules!
Song: Buzzcocks - Harmony In My Head

segment:What's Wrong With Ballet?

Ricky: Buzzcocks, "Harmony In My Head". Now, things are flying here at XFM. W- we- people have called in, there is a video of "Freaks" on the way, Karl's gonna see that within the week. That's exciting. That's exciting for me, do ya know what I mean?
Steve: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Ricky: About the education of Karl. We started off trying to teach him about science and history and now we just find that he likes pictures of hairy Chinese kids and...
Karl: Who doesn't?
Ricky: Women- "who doesn't", no, true. You've got a theory about pictures of freaks, haven't ya?
Karl: Uhhhh... it.... I- y- ya see, you always bring things up that I don't want to talk about. Cuz I'm- I'm really worried that people- if you've just tuned in for the first time, it's the first time you hear it and we're talking about hairy Chinese kids--
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Talking about "The Human.... Worm"--
Ricky: Karl- Karl, listen, people don't think that you're taking the piss out of those people - they lump you in with them.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: They- do you know what I mean? They- they think that you're a freak of nature. S- so you can say anything you want. Do you know what I mean?
Pause
Ricky: Cuz it's honest, it's from the heart, it's geniune... So, don't worry about that--
Karl: Yeah, but Suzanne was sayin' last night that I- I've just- I've got a heart of stone or whatever it is.
Ricky: Why?
Karl: Because- because I wasn't cryin' at "Comic Relief"... And all- all I- was just to say to her, "Get out 'Elephant Man', let me watch that for thirty minutes, I'll be cryin' me heart out."
Ricky: Why? Why do you care about that but not...about--
Karl: Because it's- that- that is more real, innit, right. Think of John Merrick--
Ricky: Sorry, sorry... What, the film starring John Hurt is more real than footage of starving people in Africa?
Karl: No, but what I'm sayin' is - think about... See, this is why I didn't want to bring it up because people are gonna--
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: Just say--
Ricky: Well you're allowed to cry at what you like, you can't h- people can't have you for not crying at sommat and crying at sommat else.
Karl: Yeah, but imagine- imagine- imagine that. Like, if you've seen the film, you know, his head's all, you know, messed up and that.
Ricky: Yeh.
Karl: He's gettin' picked on all the time...
Ricky: Yeh.
Karl: It's just--
Steve: By Michael Elphick, I remember.
Ricky and Karl: Yeah.
Karl: It's just really, really sad. Whereas, you know, we're trying to help out people--
Ricky: But ya- ya give him a bun and he forgets it.
Pause
Karl: D'ya know what I mean, though?
Steve: He never forgets, Rick.
Ricky Explodes with Laughter

Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Ehhm, time for "Fi--"
Ricky: Tell 'em your theory about pi- pi- freaks who have their picture taken.
Karl: No, I- I'd leave it. Leave it.
Ricky: No, can I tell you--
Karl: We'll do it next week, though.
Ricky: Can I tell you what this is?
Steve: Go on. Quickly, what is it?
Ricky: Right, when he sees a little picture, like in these books he's got - he carries 'round those things, right--
Steve: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ricky: And there's, like, a fella with a little head with some, like, uh, uh, able-bodied people, he goes, "The only reason- he must know the only reason they've got to take that picture, right, was so they could show their mates, say, 'Look at me with the fella with the little head.'"
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: That's what- that's his theory.
Steve: Yeah. That every picture of a- of a- of a freak, they're being--
Karl: Steve, let me describe the picture to ya.
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: This little fella with a little head...
Ricky Giggles Quietly
Steve: Right.
Karl: Playing n- on the piano...
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) I've seen it!
Ricky Giggles
Karl: All his family stood around and mates and that. When have you ever seen a picture of someone playing the piano and everybody wants to be in on it?
Steve: (Laughing) Right.
Ricky Continues Giggling
Karl: Doesn't happen.
Steve: Maybe it was one of those, kind of, Christmas Cards they send out to everyone.
Karl: It wasn't. It wasn't. It wasn't. You could see one of 'em, it was, like, in a rush to go away, he was probably... eh, planned to go out, and he was like- but they were takin' a picture, it's, "Aww, I'll be in it then before I go out". And it was all- it's out of order.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky Laughs Slightly
Karl: If you se- do you know the one I mean?
Steve: (Laughing Slightly) I do know the one you mean, yeah.
Karl: There you go, then.
Ricky: (Laughing Slightly) What about the one in the, uhh- when you went down to Cornwall - in that little pub?
Karl: We'll talk about that next week?
