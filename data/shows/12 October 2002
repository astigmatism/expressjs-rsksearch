Steve: Chill, chill, chill.
Ricky: I had to go to Capital library, er, oh-
Steve: Chill, chill, chill, chill.
Ricky: Fancy that, I had to go to Capital library to get a couple of records I wanted, right? Place is falling apart, the email's not working, it's so shoddy. He's had two weeks off. "Ooh, I'm on holiday." I mean, they, really, they might as well bulldoze this, honestly. 'Cause for all the- you know.
Steve: It is ludicrous.
Ricky: And, we get paid... peanuts.

Karl: Well, it wasn't all fun was it, because me dad was in, er, was in hospital.
Ricky: Oh, but he wasn't-
Steve: He wasn't during the holiday.
Ricky: -not during the holiday though, was he? You came back from holiday and then found that out, didn't you?
Karl: Yeah, but it happened when I was on holiday.
Ricky: Did you know that though, When you were on holiday?
Karl: No, 'cos I didn't take me phone with me.
Steve: Well, that's our question-
Ricky: Yeah, okay.
Karl: But the weird thing is, I got- I got a feeling. When I was sat there. 'Cos it normally happens-
Ricky: It wasn't the nudist beach was it?
Karl: -when I first went away to-
Ricky: When you saw that old fella with his packet out?
Ricky sniggers
Karl: -when I went to Ibiza, right. I, er, I had a feeling, and I called home and me dad had punctured a lung.
Steve: When you say you had a feeling, what do you mean, a feeling?
Karl: Just like "Oh, I should call home, there's something not right."
Steve: Mmm. That's a very specific feeling, how did that ma-
Ricky laughs
Steve: -how did that manifest itself?
Ricky: Hold on-
Steve: How does that- how do you get that? What kind of feeling is that-

Steve: Well, yeah-
Ricky: You know what I mean? I don't usually get out of bed for-

Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.

Ricky: Was that Mad Liar Charlie?
Steve laughs
Ricky: No, 'cos he's famous for that.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Well, I'm sure, you know-
Ricky: Yeah, I think that was Mad Liar Charlie.
Karl: Right, so I was reading that and then after a couple of days I was a bit like "Oh..."
Steve: Boring.
Karl: Yeah, you can do- you can only do sort of so much lying around.
Steve: And so much reading.
Karl: So, err, Suzanne said "Well, let's go on the beach, have a walk."
Steve: You hadn't gone on the beach?
Ricky: Where had to been up to this point then? In the- In your room?
Karl: No, just like, around the pool, just- just relaxing-
Steve: Mmm.
Ricky: Sure, yeah.
Karl: -and having a swim and that.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Erm, so she said "Well, let's go on the beach." and I said "Oh, alright then, yeah." So, err, wandered down to the beach, and, err, first impressions are "Yeah, it's alright. It's clean."
Steve laughs
Karl: Err "Sea look good."
Steve: Your criteria is so basic, it's brilliant.
Ricky laughs
Steve: "Hotel, yes, roof, good, food, adequate, beach, clean. Next."
Karl: So, I'm walking along, and everything's good and, err, you know, there's a woman, err, feeding fish bread, which I thought "Well, that's different."
Ricky and Steve burst out laughing
Ricky: Oh, wh-
More laughing
Ricky: I love that. He likes originality. He loves a bit of originality.
Steve: She was feeding fish bread?!
Karl: This woman was there, like up to her- up to her knees in water-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And she was stood there-
Ricky: Was that the sea?
Karl: -chucking- yeah- ch-chucking this bread and I thought "What's she doing?" and I stood there and watched for a minute-
Ricky sniggers
Karl: -and there was little fish coming up, having the bread. I thought "Ah."
Ricky laughs
Karl: So we c- we carried on walking, and err, everything's going well, and then this fella comes towards me-
Steve: "Everything's going well."
Ricky: I know, yeah. "Yeah, that's original."
Steve: "I haven't fallen over."
Ricky: "Clean- clean, feeding bread, ah, two points for originality. Yeah, yeah."
Steve: "It's going well, it's going well."
Karl: Fella comes walking towards me-
Steve: Oi oi.
Karl: -he's only got no pants on.
Steve: Ohh.
Karl: So I said "Suzanne, what's going on?"
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Why does he turn to her? Like she knows more.
Karl: So she said- so she said "Oh, yeah, yeah, it's err..." She said "Yeah, it's a nudist beach."
Ricky: Is this going to be a long story, cos could- could you pour that coffee? Could you give me that coffee over?
Steve: Erm.
Ricky: Sorry- sorry, this is really bad. Ugh, yeah, cos he's pour- thank you.
Steve: Just amuse yourselves, while we-
Ricky: Thank you very much.
Steve: -sort the coffee.
Karl: Steve- Steve, do you want-
Steve: I'll have a cup of coffee Karl, thanks, yeah, cheers.
Ricky sips his cup of coffee
Ricky: Ugh. Cold. Right, good, okay.
Karl: So-
Steve: Great. Thank you.
Karl: So, she said "Yeah, it's a, err- it's a nudist beach." So I said "Well, why- wha-" I said "We're all mixed- mix- it's all mixed up." Normally on a nudist beach- it's a nudist beach innit, you don't go wandering on there when you've got your clothes on an' that.
Steve: Mmm.
Karl: So, it annoyed me a bit, cos there wasn't any signs. So this fella is getting closer-
Ricky: Well the knob out was a sign.
Karl: Yeah. Right, so he's getting closer, and he walked past me, it was an old fella, err, and he walked past and he had a hat on and, err, and a little pipe-
Ricky sniggers
Karl: -and a big rucksack on his back. Right, so it got me think-
Ricky: So not strictly naked.
Karl: -I'm walking along and I'm thinking 'Right, why do people wanna do this?'. So straight away he was- I wasn't on holiday anymore, cos most of the time when i'm on holiday I don't think about anything.
Ricky laughs
Karl: Right, I just-
Steve: You're minds ablank.
Karl: -I just switch off.
Ricky laughs
Karl: Right. But all- all of a sudden this- this has got in me head now, and I've turned round to- to look at him, and-
Steve: Check out his arse.
Ricky bursts into more laughters
Karl: -and the bag- and this bag, right, I swear, it was-
Ricky: (???) Ballsack.
Karl: -it was MASSIVE, right.
Ricky: What?
Steve: He had a massive bag.
Karl: The- the bag- the-
Karl almost laughs
Steve: His rucksack.
Karl: His rucksack.
Ricky: Oh right, okay.
Karl: So-
Karl giggles quietly
Ricky: When I said- he said there's an old couple coming towards me, I said "What was lower, the bloke's testicles or the woman's tits?" and he said "That was another point, she might as well have wore knickers."
Steve laughs
Ricky: Cos it's so low- he could see- that's what he said, to me.
Steve: So you saw the bag...
Karl: So it annoyed me, yeah, because the whole idea innit- ah- this is what I think- I mean I might be wrong, right-
Ricky holds back laughter
Steve: Chances are-
Ricky: You never have been.
Steve: -quite strong.
Ricky: You never have been before.
Karl: Being nudist, right, what's it all about?
Ricky and Steve hold back more laughter
Steve: Tell you what, on that- on that.. point, Karl, let's play a tune- let's come back, and we'll discuss-
Ricky: What are we gonna play?
Steve: -we'll discuss that very issue. We have- we've got some ideas, we did chat about this last week, Karl, in your absence.

Ricky: yeah
Karl: ..Natural, letting the breeze, you know, blow around you an' that.. tha-that's the only thing I can think is-of-of like the bonus of doing it
Steve grunts in understanding
Karl: But. You can get that, by just having a pair of shorts on, alright? Coz, I-I'm not one for gettin me kit off. It's just something, a bit weird about it, innit normally, if I go for a walk on the beach, I'll...I'll put a shirt on

Karl: but leave it unbottoned
Ricky: Yeah
Ricky makes some sarcastic impressed sounds
Steve: Tease the ladies, sure.

Ricky and Steve: alright
Karl: I've got a pair of shorts on and I'm not looking at him thinking "(gasps and exhales)I bet he's really comfy"

Steve: (surprised)Did we?
Ricky: Yeah, we did- go on, yeah?
Karl: Right.
Ricky: --
Karl: Yeah, I thought of some-
Ricky: This isn't like radio, is it, like we know it. This is just people talking.
Steve: Mm.
Ricky: If the mic's on, it's luck!
Steve laughs.
Steve: Yeah!
Ricky: If anyone's listening- I, you know, have no idea what they think of this show.
Steve: Mm. Mm-hmm.
Ricky: It's not a show!
Steve: Not in the traditional sense.
Ricky: No! Okay then, you're gonna change all that, Karl?
Steve: Cause a show suggests a certain form of presentation-
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: -a certain pride-
Ricky: -and when we do present it-
Steve: -and dare I say: some plannling.
Ricky: Yeah. And when we do, it's ruined by him pressing the wrong buttons.
Karl: But I've got some planning 'ere.
Ricky: Go on then.
Steve: ?Cause he is?
Karl: Uhh- what I did was, when I was on holiday-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: -right? I- you said: Come up with a new idea, right?
Steve: Mm.
Karl: So the best way of coming up with an idea is, sort of,-
Steve chuckles
Ricky: Thinkin'!
Karl: -sort of nicking a TV show name, and then twistin' it abit.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: So-
Ricky: Or just read off Simon Matto- Simon Mayo's idea completely.
Karl: Alright-
Steve: Good advice for anyone out there.
Karl: -I did-
Ricky laughing
Ricky: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Steve: -interested in ideas.
Ricky: ?Karl is presently running a course, writing for TV.

Ricky: -and that's lesson one, isn't it?
Steve: That's lesson one.
Ricky: -rip summat else off-
Steve: -just doing it, and change the title slightly.
Ricky: Yeah. Go on.
Karl: This one I haven't really got a- I don't know what to do on the game, but I'm thinking-
Both snigger.
Karl: -Strike it Ricky?
Steve howling
Steve: That's all you got?
Karl: That's-
Steve: That's all you've come up with?
Karl: -follow that through-
Steve: -how long did that take?
Ricky: What is that?
Karl: I just thought it sounded a bit like: Lucky.
Steve howls.
Karl: Forget that one then!
Ricky: Forget that, yeah. Okay, no, don't, no, no. We all- we - not even Spielberg- not all his films, you know, could hit the- go on!
Steve laughing throughout.
Karl: Right...
Ricky: (intense)Yeah, is good. Go on.
Karl: D'ya remember Big Brother?
Ricky: Yeah. Do I remember Big Brother!? No, go on!
Karl: Big Mother, right? You call in, if your mum's heavy, you win a CD.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: (Laughing)Ka-a-arl. What d'you mean? How can you- how can you prove that?
Karl: Alright. Forget that.
Both still laughing. Ricky bursts out anew.
Karl: Right, ay 'ere.
Ricky: (imitating)Ay ere! Good one. You got-
Karl: No. --
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: The Price is Right, remember that?
Ricky and Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Right-
Steve: The Price is Ricky?
Karl: No. The Rice is Right, and what I'd do. I read from an Indian menu and a Chinese menu, you tell me whether you have pilau or egg-fried.
Ricky bursts.
Ricky: He's a genius, in't he? He really is a modern-
Steve: I don't understand that one.
Ricky: -let. Go on, then. Go into the- Let's go into this one. Let's not cross this one off right away. Go on, what d- you read from what?
Karl: Well, I've got- I get a couple of menus from like an Indian and a Chinese take-away.
Ricky and Steve: Yeah.
Karl: -and I'll go, like, right...uuh: Chicken Korma.
Ricky: Well, could I just suggest that as it's an Indian it will be pilau, and anything you read out that, is-
Karl: Yeah, but you don't know which one I'm reading from.
Ricky: (angry)Whatthen chicken korma is Indian, isn't is?
Karl: Yeah, so you go pilau.
Steve chuckles
Karl: but then.--
Ricky: But then you might as well say Indian or Chinese!
Karl: No, because then the name wouldn't work. The Rice is Right.
Ricky: Oh, okay, I forgot you're working with the titles backwards, aren't you. Okay, yeah.
Steve: I'm so confused-
Ricky laughs
Steve: -I don't know where I am or what- what day it is.
Karl: A programme that they're binning on Channel Four, right-
Ricky: Could you cross that out, we're not doing The Rice is Right.
Steve: I don't understand The Rice is Right.
Ricky: No. Go on.
Karl: I tell you that later, we'll have a game in the office, right?
sniggering
Karl: A game that they're binning on Channel Four, but has got really big viewing figures-
Ricky: Well, obviously not, or they-
Karl: --
Ricky: -wouldn't be binning it. Go on.
Karl: Do you know 15 to 1?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: They're getting rid of that, right.
Ricky: Are they?
Karl: I'm thinking: 15 Taiwan.
Steve laughs.
Karl: Get some items that are made in Taiwan, right? Get 15 items and you- I say what they are, and then you go: Ooh, I bet it's the vase...or something.
Ricky: That's the one that's made in Taiwan?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: (laughing)Just explain that again very quickly.
Ricky: (laughing)No, don't, Karl! Cross it out.
Karl: Oh, right. Forget that-
Ricky: Cross it out. 15 Taiwan.
Steve chuckles
Karl: Right.
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: This is the one that I've prepared for, cause I think this-
Steve: ---
Karl: -isn't daft, this is good.
Steve: Let's play a tune, and then hear it after that.
Ricky: (laughing)Oh, God.
Karl: Are you sure?
Steve: I'm very excited.
Karl: Are we gonna play it after that or are we gonna say-

Karl: Well you can join in and stuff, for that.
Ricky: Yeah, okay.
Steve: But the problem is Karl, why do you rush to do it? We- I've told you before we should practice these things. That's how it's done.
Ricky: Although to be fair Steve, I can't- I haven't got time to do anything so at least Karl's coming up with stuff.
Steve: But I don't mind you know, running through with it-
Ricky: What other ideas have you got?
Steve: -while you're having a kip outside, during the records.

Steve: Say that again?
Karl: "Hanging bacon".
Steve: "Hanging bacon"?
Karl: All the titles-
Ricky: Francis Bacon?
Karl: No, all the titles are sort of names that sort of make- sort of tease you and get you more interested in it.
Steve: "Hanging bacon", well you've certainly intrigued me.
Ricky: Go on, what's another title of one?
Karl: Uh..."Hairy chinese kid".
Ricky and Steve start laughing
Ricky: Could I- I'm gonna go for that one.
Karl: No.
Steve: If there was-
Ricky: Could I-
Steve: -if there was a university degree-

Karl: Well, teaching you something. "Educating Ricky". Alright?
Ricky: So, are we playing it now? We're already into feature- well into this feature are we?
Karl: Yeah, I suppose we are, yeah.
Ricky and Steve laugh
Steve: Should there not be a jingle or something?
Ricky: Yeah, can we have a jingle?
Karl: Well there's no point, 'cause look I come up with ideas and you dismiss 'em straight away, so I'm not wasting me time making stuff...
Ricky: Right.
Karl: ...If you don't like it.
Ricky: Well okay, let's play- let's play Educating Ricky.
Karl: Right.
Ricky: Brilliant. Go...
Ricky and Karl: Right.
Karl: So-
Ricky improvises a jingle for Educating Ricky

Karl: Right. What we going for then? "Hanging the bacon", "hairy chinese kid"...
Ricky chuckles quietly
Karl: "Alien gives man a beard"
Steve: I think "alien gives man a beard", we're all excited about it.
Ricky: I'd like to do that.
Karl: Right. There's this fella, I think it happened in America. Uh...
Ricky stifles a laugh
Karl: And he saw a bright light in the sky. And uh...
Ricky chuckles
Ricky: Karl, if you're bored...
Karl: And he's stood there.
Steve: This is a true story, is it?
Karl: Yeah. He's stood there...
Ricky: "Yes", of course it isn't, Steve!
Steve chuckles
Karl: And he saw this bright light, and it came closer and closer and it was a UFO. Right?
Ricky and Steve giggle
Steve: Yep.
Karl: And he looked at it, and it disappeared. Right? And he gets back in his car...
Ricky and Steve are still giggling
Steve: He looks in the mirror?
Karl: And he looks in the mirror.
Steve: Yep.
Karl: He's only got a beard.
Steve: He hasn't.
Ricky laughs
Steve: I can't believe it.
Ricky: You sure it wasn't someone else who got in the car? And he was still standing out there.
Karl: No. Right?
Ricky: What?
Karl: And it turned out-
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: -he got home, and said to his wife or- or his girlfriend uh..."It's a bit weird"...
Ricky and Steve giggling
Karl: Said "I just got out of the car to look at a bright light and I...I got back in the car and grew a beard." And she said "Never mind your beard, where have you been for three days?"
Ricky burst out laughing
Karl: And what had happened is-
Steve: He passed out 'cause he was pissed.
Karl: No. The UFO had taken him for three days.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: But he'd only thought he'd only looked at it, and it went away.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: But what had happened is-
Ricky: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Karl: They took him, and he grew a beard 'cause he hasn't had a shave.
Ricky: Um...right, okay...I mean...was Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones anything to do with this at all? Or were you- did you see this on a video maybe and thought it was an educational film?
Karl: No, it's from a book that some kind person sent in to me here...um-
Steve: Can I just ask again, just again I'm throwing this right back at ya. Um, do you think there's any other possible answer here? Right, a man is absent for three days from home-
Ricky: He's grown a beard.
Steve: -the length of time that it could take to grow a beard, lest we forget. Um, what if he hadn't actually seen a bright light in the sky?
Ricky: What if he was lying?
Steve: What if he was being drunk, he'd got knocked unconscious-
Ricky: Hm.
Steve: -he'd had a car crash-
Ricky: Just lying. No, just lying.
Steve: -any number of other things? Or he was just lying.
Ricky: Yeah, he'd been on a bender getting pissed for three days with his mates
Steve: Yeah, and that was his excuse to his wife.
Ricky: And they went "What are you gonna- Dennis, what are you gonna tell your wife?"
Steve: "Uhm...well wait a minute..."
Ricky: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait wait uh...
Steve: "She's not gonna believe I was out with you lads, uh.."
Ricky: "Just say you were only away for a minute." "No, she'll know I wasn't away for a minute 'cause of the beard."
Steve chuckles
Ricky: "Oh yeah, it looks like we've been out for three days." "Well we have, thats..."
Steve: Exactly.
Ricky: "Right, okay we've got to cover that then"
Steve: "Hm hm hm hm hmmm."
Ricky: "Uh...alien abduction?"
Steve: "Great one."
Ricky: "Okay, let's try that."
Steve: That's a little scenario there that could've been played out.
Ricky: Sorry, when you say educating Ricky what have I learned from this? Never listen to you again. That's all I've learned so far, never listen to you.
Karl: Well, here y'are, We'll add a little bit more in here, right, to spice this up.
Ricky: Well, no! What do you mean, add a little bit more?
Karl: We'll add a bit more to this- to this- what I'm educating you about.
Ricky: Go on.
Karl: Right? Um...there's only a law in America that says if you touch a UFO you're gonna get done. Now why would they make a rule...I don't know the- do you know like, all their rules have a code-
Ricky: I- Karl. I-I genuinely do not know what you're talking about.
Karl: Right. Do you know like how here, they might have-
Ricky: Ka- Do you know what-
Steve: I have no idea.
Ricky: Okay.
Karl: Right. Do you know like over here-
Steve: Rick, I'm listening to Capital in these headphones.
Ricky laughs
Steve: I've got- I've got Foxy on, from yesterday.
Karl: Let's- Let's bin that.
Steve: No, it's great. No, Karl-
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Ah- I wanna hear about hairy chinese kid!
Steve: Let's play a tune and let's come back with hairy chinese kid
Ricky: Okay, play a tune and come back with hairy chinese kid, definitely.
Karl: Play a bit- some Doors?
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Yeah I just thought, uh, I'd go back- take you back to the 60's, this is a tune that a friend of mine sent me.
Ricky: If you touch a UFO you get done.
Steve: Soul Kitchen from The Doors
Karl: Shambles today, this.
Ricky chuckles
Song: The Doors - Soul Kitchen

segment:Eczema and a Boil

Song: David Bowie - Slow Burn fading out
Ricky: David Bowie, Slow Burn. Quite a- quite a Eno trilogy feel about it-
Steve: Yeah, not bad at all yeah
Ricky: Lodger and sort of Low type.
Steve: Is it a new tune?
Ricky: Yeah. But uh...yeah.
Steve: Enjoyable.
Ricky: Um, now...okay...That's stressful, innit? We- I think we've got things working now. We've had people coming in and out, just shaking their head going "shouldn't have bought that desk."
Steve: Hm.
Ricky: But it's all sorted now I think. And uh, oh...I- I'm sorry
Steve: You noticed how it took, um-
Ricky: What?
Steve: -about 25 minutes for them to come down as well though. Do you feel like we're maybe quite low in the pecking order in the building?
Ricky: Definitely.
Steve: You know it's like Capital first, Capital gold, they can shoot off, do other sort of pirate stations.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Peoples car radios, then they come back here.
Ricky giggling
Ricky: Yeah. Oh dear...Oh, had a job at Richer Sounds.
Steve chuckles
Steve: Yeah, yeah.
Ricky: Light fitting was uh, bzzt, buzzing. Um, now...but, we've got um, thanks for staying...listening. Um right, okay Educating Ricky, what have we got? Hairy Chinese Kid, go on.
Karl: Right, yeah. This is the uh, I didn't wanna do this.
Ricky: What do you mean you didn't want to do it?
Karl: Well I wanted to give you three, and- and I gave you one, it was like "alien man gets a beard" or whatever-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: and-
Ricky: Which was total rubbish, so this one should be better maybe.
Karl: Hairy Chinese Kid, right. Well, we've talked about hairy people in the past.
Ricky and Steve laugh
Steve: True enough.
Karl: 'Aven't we? Um...you know the- the little kids who grew up in woods, and hung aroung with wolves and that.
Ricky: Yeah. Again, you're confusing uh, yeah they're not- there were some people that were born...very hirsute. They were not the people who were brought up with wolves, you've just put that together in your Homer Simpson-type mind.
Karl: Right, well this is like a sort of- sorta close to that sort of story.
Ricky: Yeah.
Ricky and Steve giggling
Karl: Uh...But the wierd this is, right? Chinese people aren't that hairy. As a- as a nation.
Steve laughs softly
Karl: No seriously. That's a well known fact
Steve laughs again
Ricky: oh god...
Karl: They don't have that much body hair, and stuff.
Ricky: right, okay,
Karl: And so, this little kid who was born over there, um...he was like covered in the stuff.
Steve: Was he?
Karl: And it was only his nose that wasn't hairy. The rest of his body was caked in hair, right?
Steve: Mm.
Karl: Um, and his hair sort of grew-
Ricky: What sort of hair was it? Was it-
Karl: Thick. Thick hair.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: No. What I mean is, was it sort of uh, like a pony's mane, so he just looked like an Ewok? You know what I mean, just like hanging down sort of straight, dark hair.
Karl: Well it looked- in the picture it looked like, uh- It grows from his eyebrows-
Ricky: Was it downy?
Karl: It grows from his eyebrows quite thick, and then it just goes all the way over his head.
Ricky: You don't think it was just really long eyebrows that he'd done a comb over?
Karl: No, it was all over his body, it had a picture of like his back and that.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And uh-
Steve: Had he styled it- Had he styled it at all? Did he have it in a quiff, or?
Karl: No, it was just- It was just all over him.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: And uh...And they were like, you know, "This is a bit weird." Happening uh- happening in China-
Steve: Mm.
Ricky snickers
Karl: -where they're not normally that hairy.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: That was the scientist speaking.
Steve: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Karl: And uh, the press- the local press and that were getting him down, calling him Monkey Boy and all this.
Steve: Oh...
Karl: And uh-
Steve: Stinking Chinese press.
Ricky chuckles
Karl: But the doctor-
Ricky: Yeah. Aw...
Steve: They're cruel, aren't they?
Karl: The doct-
Steve: It's like those game shows. That's japanese isn't it?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And the doctor said, um-
Ricky: Was Karl talking like through all that time where we were just like doing the...
Steve Chuckles
Steve: I don't know
Ricky: 'Cause I turned around and I still saw he was talking...Go on.
Steve: So anyway, the local press came down to see the hairy boy. The monkey boy...
Karl: Yeah, and they were like being tight and taking the mickey out of him, and the doctor said, uh-
Ricky: Showing him nuts.
Karl: -said "He's only- He's only hairy" Said um... "He's a healthy young kid, the only faults he's got is he's got a little bit of eczema, and a boil."
Ricky laughs
Karl: And he said "Everybody should just treat him the same." and- I think he grew up a healthy- healthy kid. Um...yeah, so that's- that's the uh-
Ricky: That's-
Steve: That's the end of the story?
Ricky: That's not a story.
Karl: Why?
Ricky: But I've- We'll I've got nothing- I don't know what to say to that. So someone was- someone in China was born slightly hairier than the rest, and he was normal apart from eczema and a boil? That to me isn't a story.
Steve Chuckles
Ricky: But I- If it is, I've got a million. I mean...it's sort of like "Bloke from Manchester went a bit balder than the rest, got a job on radio. He were normal." I mean that's not a story, is it? Do you know what I mean?
Karl: Alright then.
Steve: Hang on, hang on, hang on-
Ricky: Hold on, he's got the big guns. You're not gonna give us Hanging Bacon are ya?
Karl: Yep,
Steve chuckles
Steve: Hoo-hoo!
Ricky: Come on then. Come on then, come on.
Karl: Right.
Steve: This is the one we've been looking forward to. This is it.
Karl: No, this is a good one.
Steve: This is the one.
Karl: And this is a story, right? Uh- Do you know the saying, uh, "Chewing the fat"?
Ricky: Good one, it's one of my favorites.
Karl: Yeah?
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Do you know what it means?
Ricky: Talking.
Karl: Right. Well, do you know where it came from.
Steve: No.
Karl: Right, what they used to do years ago, when people didn't have much money-
Ricky: Is this the same as throwing the baby out with the bathwater?
Karl: No it's not th- well it's not the same saying, but it's-
Ricky: No, but I mean is it as wrong as that was?
Karl: Right, well let me tell ya and we'll see.
Ricky: Go on. Okay.
Karl: Um...like people go out to work, and with the money they'd buy food...
Ricky: Oh yeah, go on.
Steve laughs
Ricky: This is a good system, wh-wha- go on. What do- what do you mean? People go out to work and with the system- well go on.
Karl: And if- if you were quite well off you might treat your family to some bacon, right? But do you know like, in these days if people earn a lot of money they might buy a nice suit-
Ricky: Or s-
Karl: -or a car.
Ricky: Yeah, yeah yeah. So- eh- well, what are you saying? You're s- wa-wait a minute let me get this straight. You're saying that you go out to work and get money to- to buy things to live and if you get sort of enough money to live, and you've got some left over you might treat yourself on like a suit or a car or some- is that what you're...
Karl: Yeah, yeah.
Ricky: Oh, go on.
Karl: But back then- back then if you had money they'd say-
Steve: This is olden times?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: Okay.
Karl: "Let's get some bacon in." Right?
Steve chuckles
Karl: And what they'd do..They'd hang it in the kitchen.
Steve: What, to show it off?
Karl: To show it off to all their neighbors and friends. 'Cause if you were- if you had hanging bacon it was like "He's doing alright for himself."
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: Some lovely bacon.
Karl: So they had loads of bacon hanging up, and people would come 'round, right? and whilst they're stood in the kitchen talking about whatever they're talking about-
Steve: In olden times.
Karl: -they'd say uh..."Do you want a bit of rind?" And they'd- and they'd rip a little bit of rind off, and whilst they're having a- having a chit-chat-
Ricky: Chewing the fat.
Karl: -they'd chew on the rind-
Ricky: Well I think that's probably true.
Karl: -and they'd say-
Ricky: I'd hadn't heard that, but that one to me sounds true. Do you see the difference between that one and "A man was abducted and grew a beard"? Do- can you see the difference-
Karl: Yeah, but they're different-
Ricky: -in why I accept that story...
Karl: -different stories for different...things.
Ricky and Steve laugh
Ricky: Different stories for different things! So- see that's a nice- that's a nice story if it's- I don't know if it's true, I mean- but it seems totally possible, viable, quite interesting. I won't be quoting that myself until I've verified it, but that's- you know, I won't be telling anyone the bloke who got in the car and he had a full-faced beard.
Steve chuckles
Ricky: Why hadn't his car been towed away?
Karl: Because it was a quiet road.
Ricky: Was it?
Karl: It wasn't in the way.
Steve still chuckling
Steve: Are you filling in the blanks again?
Ricky laughs
Steve: That wasn't in the book was it, that you read? See that's just the thing, sometimes I think you make up bits of the story as though they were fact. That doesn't seem right.
Karl: Well that's all you can do, innit?
Ricky and Steve chuckle
Karl: So...So that's Educating Ricky, will we-
Ricky: Brilliant.
Karl: -do that next week?
Ricky: That is brilliant, Karl.
Steve: No, I think that was good. I-I do- I mean I enjoyed that, I learned something from that.
Ricky: I mean w- just- just, I wanna get a- I mean this is all from one book is it?
Karl: Yep.
Steve: It's an interesting book.
Ricky: Um...with the- with the- I don't want to dwell on it, but with the- with the hairy chinese kid, what did they say about that? What was the...ehm...was it "Once there was born a kid who was slightly more hairy then everyone else, but it's alright, he only had a boil." How did they word it? How did they- how did this catch your imagination?
Steve: There was a picture.
Karl: Well, it was a picture that grabbed me first of all.
Steve: Yeah, yeah.
Ricky: Sure.
Karl: And uh, it was like "God, what's up with him?" And that's when I read it, and it said-
Ricky: Did you see the boil and the eczema, or just the hair?
Karl: No, you see- because his face is like- just under his eyes is sort of nice and smooth, and his nose is sticking out and that's not hairy. But the rest of him- he looked like he had this sort of a balaclava on or something. And then- and then I read on and it's like "This was a hairy kid in China."
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: So...
Ricky: Yeah. Okay, good. Anything else in there? Because- I mean I like- I like that.
Karl: No, well we'll do more of that next week.
Steve: Educating Ricky
Ricky: How- how is that alongside um, Hanging Bacon, Alien Abduction, um- Hairy Chinese Kid and uh, a little interesting fact about the derivation of a phrase?
Karl: ...What do you mean?
Steve: He didn't understand a word of that, play a record.
Ricky laughs
Steve: I knew the word "derivation" was going to cause problems. I thought "derivation shouldn't have come out."
Ricky still laughing
Song: Beck - Lost Cause

segment:That Song's Got a Good Story

Song: Beck - Lost Cause fading out
Ricky: Now I'm not- I wasn't disputing. He's all smug 'cause he just had a phone call. That was um, Beck, Lost Cause. Go on, tell- tell 'em why you're all smug.
Karl: Because Adrian just called up-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: after hearing the story about the Chinese kid-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And he said "Yeah, that's true, there was a TV program on it."
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: He had a uh, a chromosome defect.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: And it made him hairy, and his mom and dad had- used to have to shave him. That wasn't in the book. But um...thinking about it, that's not a good move anyway, is it?
Steve: what, 'cause-
Karl: 'Cause they say that for women, if you get a few hairs on your top tip don't shave it 'cause it'll grow back thicker and faster. So-
Ricky: Right.
Steve: They should just, what, let 'em-
Karl: They should've just said "Well, let's see how- how bad it gets."
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: But if they- if they went in there straight away as a- if he came out as a baby and a little bit hairy, they should have left it-
Steve laughs
Karl: for a little bit. But Adrian called up and said um, "yeah, he was hairy, he was alright."
Ricky: Yeah, but we weren't disputing there was a, uh, a Chinese kid born slightly hairier than the rest.
Steve: We were disputing the fact that you didn't actually tell us a story.
Ricky: And-
Steve: You just told us a sort of selection of facts.
Ricky: And what we are disputing is that that man was abducted by aliens for three days and grew a beard.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: That's definitely not true.
Karl: Yeah, well...
Ricky: We don't know about chewing the fat but it sounds quite viable.
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: You see the difference is between me and Steve and you is that, ah, what we believe isn't random. Do you know what I mean? It's not random, the things that-
Steve: We don't believe stuff just 'cause it's interesting.
Ricky: It's not every other thing we believe, and every other thing we don't. We sort of like-
Steve: Well I think Karl believes stuff if it's interesting.
Ricky: Yeah, I know. I know, yeah.
Steve: If he thinks "Oh, intriguing"...fact.
Ricky: Mm. He said uh- he said to me on the w- um, *mumbles* he said uh, "That Hollies record, 'he ain't heavy he's me brother', what's that about then?" And I went "Oh I don't know. I heard it was about someone has a disabled brother, and um, he was lifting him in and out of a car or something, and someone said "Oh, do you want a hand?" And he went "No, he's not heavy, he's my brother." I.E.-
Steve: Mm-hmm.
Ricky: This isn't a burden for me.
Steve: Yes, yeah.
Ricky: Right?
Steve: Yes.
Ricky: Karl, what did you say?
Karl: Uh...I'd say-
Ricky: No, I'll tell you what he said. He went "Well that's ridiculous, he was still heavy."
Steve makes a noise
Ricky: And, he said "And don't turn down help."
Steve laughs
Karl: Which...we were talking about that, because a new feature we start on about this time every week-
Steve: Oh yeah.
Karl: Uh-
Ricky: We start about this time every week?
Karl: Yep.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Um, we'll do, um, That song's got a good story.
Steve: Okay.
Ricky: Yeah, love it. Love it, snappy. Go on, go on, go on.
Karl: And um- there's loads of songs out there, isn't they with uh, with songs that you couldn't fade out- when you hear them on the radio and that, you don't want anyone to talk over the start or the end-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: because it's a-
Ricky: Oh, but remember we did this once before with um, Killing Of Georgie by um, Rod Stewart.
Steve: Yep.
Ricky: And I was a bit worried that it might have been a true story, because we were, you know joking about it. And uh, he went "Oh, you know that Killing of Georgie", went "I think it is a true story." I went "Why?", he went "I listened to it again, and Rod Stewart at the beginning says 'this is, uh, one of me best friends'"
Ricky and Steve laugh
Ricky: It's brilliant, isn't it? It's genius
Karl: So there's loads of songs out there, and what I wanna do, we wanna get the audience involved in this, so-
Steve: Mm.
Karl: if you've got like a favorite song that's got a really good story-
Ricky: If you've got an audience. Yeah, go on
Karl: Right, yeah. Uh, and they'll email in, ricky dot gervais at xfm dot co dot uk, and they say what the song is now.
Steve: What would examples be, then?
Karl: Examples- ones that jump to mind straight away for me, Elvis, In The Ghetto.
Ricky: Yeah, good one.
Karl: Brilliant.
Ricky: Andrew Gold, Lonely Boy.
Steve chuckles
Steve: Absolutely
Karl: Don't know that one.
Steve: Eminem, Stan.
Karl: Right. Yeah, yeah. Good one, you couldn't fade it out, could you? 'Cause you'll go "Well what happened?"
Ricky snickers
Steve: Yeah. Yeah no, absolutely.
Karl: And that's- that's what I'm saying. Not just any sort of pop song that keeps repeating itself, and you know, it's like, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter if it skips or, you know what I mean, if you turn the radio off.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: But I'm talking about songs-
Steve: Ernie, The Fastest Milkman in the West.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: Yeah, that is a good story. That is a good story. Oh...
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: Do you know that one?
Karl: Yeah, well it's a story, yeah.
Ricky: Ted from Teddington, he drove the baker's van. Oh...
Steve: So what- what have we got then, have we got one specifically?
Karl: So we're gonna kick it off today with uh, Stevie Wonder, Living just enough For The City.
Steve: Okay.
Ricky: And uh, just- just...briefly.
Karl: Sum it up.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Right, if you haven't- if- if you are nipping out, maybe you're in the car and you're about to pull up somewhere and get out. What it's all about is, there's a lad who's growing up in like America in some rough area, right? And uh, he's trying his best to do well, and get a job and everything. But because of where he's from, it's stopping him doing that, right? It's like how I grew up on a estate in Manchester, and I had to leave there and come to London to do alright for meself.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Right? Uh, and it's his whole family, and it's a tale of like, how like, how his mum works dead hard and works loads of hours, but the kids are always well dressed and cleaned. It doesn't mean just cause you haven't got a good job you let your house run down, do you know what I mean? She's looking after it. The- the sister, you know, she hasn't got new clothes, but they're always clean, and her knees are clean I think it says at one point.
Ricky and Steve chuckle
Steve: Excellent. Clean knees, always important.
Karl: Uh, so- so will we give it a listen, let- let everyone hear it?
Ricky: Brilliant, it's a great track.
Steve: Well, I don't think Stevie can do it justice-
Ricky laughs
Steve: after that explanation.
Karl: Right, so-
Steve: I'm not sure he's gonna be able to top that.
Ricky: I hope he uses like, some sort of like backing tune to try and uh-
Steve: Try and pep it up a bit?
Ricky: Yeah.
Steve: 'Cause you have really knocked the socks off it.
Ricky: Brilliant. I'm looking forward to the clean knees.
Karl: Right, here we go then. It's a new feature, uh-
Ricky: What was it called again?
Karl: The- The story in that song's really good. Here's Stevie Wonder.

Steve: yeah I noticed you didn't, you didn't play the uh, full version (Steve ends with "version" while chuckling
Ricky: no. its a radio edit
Steve: which has obviously got the complete story in...You've um, you've just played a, uh-
Karl: I haven't heard the other-;

Steve: No he goes t-he gets uh, arrested...and goes to jail. But uh, its-he's-it's just you know just because he gets picked up because he's black. I mean he hasn't done anything wrong. There's a whole other-
Karl: never heard of that one
Steve: There's a whole other sort of section
Ricky: Maybe we should change this section
Karl: No, what we'll do. Right,
Ricky: "abridged versions of songs"
Steve Chuckles
Steve: Yeah
Karl: No. Next week, we'll play the second bit and it'll be like uh, be like Star Wars or something like that
Ricky and Steve laugh
Karl: Brilliant
Xfm opener/closer played followed by Caught by the River by Doves

segment:Give Her a Rubik's Cube

Song: Doves - Caught By The River fades out
Ricky: Doves, Caught By The River on XFM 104.9. Well it's been a good show, hasn't it? We've been sort of like- quite a rock and roll 70's feel to it, mainly the equipment. Um, but uh, we got through it. Karl's been telling us some great insights into his- his mind.
Steve: Mm.
Ricky: Really. We've had a few laughs, a few tears...bit stressful. What were you telling me in the week, about when you went to visit your dad in hospital?
Karl: Oh, talking about um, yeah, me- when I got back off holiday and me dad was- was in hospital. I shot back to see him, see how he's getting on, and hospital's are depressing places aren't they?
Steve: Mm.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Really like, pff, god you know, they d- you know, if- even if you're not that ill it makes you feel worse.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: 'Cause it's really like it drags you down, there's people walking around moaning and, you know-
Steve: You, mainly.
Ricky laughs
Karl: Well, you know.
Ricky: Nurses.
Karl: And uh, my dad was-
Steve: Ooh, political.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: is uh-
Steve: High-five.
Ricky and Steve: Satire.
Karl: Do you know what I mean though-
Steve: I would like to be around...
Ricky: 'Cause they don't get payed enough and all that.
Steve: Oh..
Ricky: And they do, like-
Karl: No, well that's um-
Steve: Tony Blair are ya listening?
Ricky chuckles
Karl: I don't- I don't want to look like I'm moaning about the people working, 'cause they all work really hard, yeah?
Ricky: Course they do, yeah.
Karl: But it's just-
Steve: God bless 'em.
Karl: -they are depressing places.
Ricky and Steve high-five
Ricky: High-five. Go on.
Karl: Nice one, nice one. Right, so um, so I'm sat there and me dad's uh, getting fed up. And uh-
Steve: Is that 'cause you're visiting?
Karl: Just, just- he's quite an active bloke-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: and all of a sudden he's gotta stay in bed and, you know it's like sit down, stop moving about and all this. So um, so he's sat there, and there's an old woman in the bed next door, right. And uh...she's- I mean she's in a bad way anyway.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Right? She must've been- she looked about...I'd say she looked about 98 or something like.
Ricky: Okay, good.
Karl: Right? Now I don't know what was wrong with her but she always- constantly moaning and you could see that the nurses were trying their best to keep her happy and she wasn't having any of it, and uh, and she was moaning 'cause her hands have gone blue.
Steve chortles
Ricky: Well that is a worry to be honest.
Karl: Well it's not, because she's 98.
Ricky: Is that what happens?
Karl: But why- why doesn't the doctor- if I was a doctor, and I'm not one, but uh-
Ricky: No, no. K-Karl don't be modest, are you a doctor, yes or no?
Karl: But- but if I was there-
Ricky: I think he's let it slip. Are y- Karl, are you a doctor?
Karl: No listen-
Ricky: Look me in the eye.
Karl: Right.
Ricky: Right, Karl-
Steve: So this woman had blue hands-
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: had she seen um, a spacecraft?
Ricky chuckles
Karl: Right, so-
Ricky: ?...Go on.
Karl: She had blue hands. Now she's 98, if I was a doctor I'd be thinking-
Ricky: No, she's not 98, you said- you said earlier on she looked about 98. So you're making that up.
Steve chuckles
Karl: She's 98-
Steve: Just shifting from speculation to fact.
Ricky: She has blue- fact now.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: Right, she's 98-
Ricky laughs
Ricky: It is fact now!
Steve: There's a hundred year old woman, go on.
Ricky: Yeah, yeah go on, yeah.
Karl: If I was a doctor I'd be thinking-
Ricky: You're not, are you? You- honestly-
Steve: He was thinking "How did I con them?"
Ricky and Steve laugh
Karl: I'd-
Steve: "How'd I get away with this?"
Karl: I'd be thinking-
Ricky: Right.
Karl: she's 98, um, she hasn't got long left. Why not just let her be at home and be happy in her own-
Steve: With her blue hands, yeah.
Karl: in her own space-
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: um, you know, and let her- let her have a nice life, whatever's left.
Ricky: Because she may hurt herself. She may have falls, some people have to go in there for their own protection. She might not have immediate family-
Steve: But more than that. she may not have been dragged in against her will.
Ricky: No, no.
Steve: She may have come to hospital because she was worried about her blue hands.
Ricky: Yeah, yeah.
Karl: Yeah but, when I was talking to Ricky he said "Oh, what it would have been" is uh, probably a bit of- did you say it's rheumatism or something?
Ricky: No I said it might- I mean, blueness can be through uh, lack of circulation.
Karl: Right, so just-
Ricky: And I'm definitely not a doctor.
Karl: You've got- you've got- you've got blue hands, bad circulation we're going to send you home. We'll give you a Rubik's Cube, um, play around with that with your hands. get- get the blood-
Ricky: Give her a Rubik's Cube!
Steve: Sure.
Karl: get the blood pumping, um, and don't worry her. Don't say "Oh, it's really bad." Just think she's 98, let her have a nice rest of the life.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: But instead she was there, and the annoying thing was- and they do this with a lot of people in hospital, they pump you with drugs-
Steve: Uh-huh.
Karl: trying to sort it out. They don't, you know- probably a bit of guesswork going on, maybe. A little bit-
Ricky: Not- not as much as you, but go on.
Karl: Right? And because of that they sort of break wind a lot. So I'm sat there with me dad talking-
Steve: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Karl: Drugs do that, Steve.
Ricky chuckles
Steve: I'm sure if there's a doctor listening or a nurse, they will clarify-
Ricky: Right.
Karl: that if they pump you with all sorts of stuff, um, it wants to come out.
Steve: Right.
Karl: So you're sat there having a serious chat, it's a quiet hospital. The woman next door with the blue hands suddenly starts seeping gas, right? Wh- I start laughing.
Steve chortles
Karl: 'Cause if there's one thing that makes you laugh, it's that innit?
Ricky: Is a- is a 98 year old lady with blue hands farting?
Karl: So you're trying to hold it in because it's a really quiet hospital and it's- it'd be obvious that we were- that I was laughing at her and I didn't want to be mean.
Ricky: No.
Karl: But it was funny. And then it got me talking about me auntie, cause me auntie Nora um, she uh- same thing. Pumped her with loads of drugs, she used to- her cabinet next to the bed is like Boots. She's got loads of stuff, right? For all sorts of stuff. And- I mean she's not that old, but she's on loads of stuff, right? And-
Steve: She's a bit coked up is she? Smack?
Karl chuckles
Karl: She uh- she called up me mam once, and uh-
Ricky: Yeah he told us this. Go on, tell it again.
Karl: And uh, she said "Oh, how are you doing?" and that. She said "Alright." uh, "Bit worried though." and me mam said "Why, what's up?" Said "I've uh, been breaking wind." So she goes "Well, yeah." Says "No, but this one is going on and on and on."
Steve laughs
Karl: And she was like- she was- she was like, wh-what would you say? Whats- passing wind, farting for five minutes. One- one thing. Not like...you know, trumping and then nothing.
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: Continuous.
Steve: Continuous drone of a fart?
Karl: Yeah.
Ricky: I don't think she had- How big was she? She must've been the size of a barn.
Karl: No, she's not that big. shes- you know, she's good for her age.
Ricky: No, but I mean-
Karl: Quite slim and that. Quite slim. It's just-
Ricky: No, but farting for five minutes. Where's all the ga- was she circular breathing? Was she sucking it in with her mouth?
Karl: It was just- I don't know. I don't know that much about it. But she called up me mam about two and a half minutes in-
Ricky laughs
Steve: Could you hear it in the background?
Ricky: Two and a half minutes in!
Steve laughs
Karl: Two and a half minutes in. She called me mam up, and it went- it went on for a further two and a half minutes.
Ricky: Oh.
Steve: And she just stayed on the phone did she?
Ricky: Where was-
Steve: She's on the phone going "Can you hear that?"
Karl Chuckles
Karl: Well...she didn't say-
Steve: Did she hold the phone next to her arse?
Ricky chuckles
Steve: "Listen to that."
Ricky: She was- she was off the ground.
Steve: "I'm trying to work a tune out."
Ricky: She was- she was actually hovering.
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: She was four foot off the ground when they found her, the ambulance men.
Steve: Yeah. The cat's dead.
Ricky laughs
Ricky: "Don't light a match! Don't light that cigarette!"
Steve: Yeah. It's like that advert. The kids come home from school, switch on the lights.
Ricky: Yeah.
Ricky and Steve laughing
Ricky: There they see granny, hovering. Turn the light on *makes a whoosing fire noise*
Steve: "Be careful if you have an elderly woman at home."
Ricky: "Drugs make you fart."
Karl: So thats- that's what I'm saying. You know, just let these people-
Ricky: What? What are you saying? No wait a minute, what are you saying?
Karl: I'm saying let people enjoy their life they've got left.
Ricky: No you're not. You're saying don't put 'em in hospital, leave them at home to die.
Karl: No, I'm not.
Ricky: Give 'em a Rubik's Cube and let 'em die, that's what your saying.
Karl: Right I'll tell you some- Here y'are, I'll tell you something now, right? Steve? I'll tell you something, and I didn't want to do it because it'd bring the show down, but she did die.
Steve: Who, the blue-handed lady?
Karl: Yeah.
Steve: How do you know?
Karl: Because I said to me dad "How's the uh, woman next door?"
Steve: "How's fartie?"
Karl: He said "Oh, she went- she went last night, they've got an old fella in there now."
Steve: God.
Karl: So, there you go. So, wouldn't it have been better to leave her at home, where her friends and family can call her and speak to her, even nip 'round if they want, you know. With a cat, I imagine.
Steve laughs
Ricky: No, it'd definitely a cat now. What was it that cat's called, do you imagine?
Karl: Proba- I'm seeing like a big ginger one so I don't know, something like, I don't know. Maybe Ginger or whatever. Um, maybe had a budgie. But that's what I'm saying, just let 'em enjoy that life because dying in hospital I wouldn't like to do it. If- If I went to the doctors and they said "You haven't got long left." I'd say "Well...I'll stay at home."
Steve: Yeah.
Karl: And that's- that's the point I'm getting at.
Ricky: Yeah.
Karl: If you can't do anything for them, let them enjoy their life.
Steve: Yeah. A Rubik's Cube.
Ricky sighs
Ricky: Right. Well um, good. That backfired. Now uh, let's play the second of the Rolling Stones tr- I'm gonna try and do this every week, it's a feature called Too lazy to go and get another album.
Steve chuckles
Steve: Yeah.
Ricky: Uh, what about a classic bit of rock and roll, yeah?
Steve: I'd love to hear it.

Karl: Drugs?
Ricky: Maybe, I'll tell you later.
